### Ibata, Gilmore & Irwin 1994

Serendipitous detection of an elongated, comoving group of stars using
spectroscopy of K and M giants when looking at the low extinction
regions near the bulge. Radial velocities taken with an accuracy of 9
km/s.

They detect a clump with vlos \~ 140 km/s with a velocity dispersion of
\~10km/s, most prominent at l=5deg, b=-15deg. They then use the
SMC-calibrated CMD to say that Sgr should be at 24 plus/minus 2 kpc from
the Sun.

*"The good match with an SMC intermediate age stellar population CMD
suggests that a significant intermediate age population is present in
the Sagittarius dwarf; the weak extension towards the blue of the
horizontal branch would imply that there is also an underlying old
stellar population present. This also is typical of Galactic dwarf
spheroidal satellites and implies that a significant population II
variable star component should be present. "*

*"The close proximity to the Galactic Centre, the morphological
appearance and the radial velocity of 140 km s\~\' indicate that this
system is currently undergoing strong tidal disruption before being
integrated into the Milky Way. The tidal limit for a bound system of
similar dynamical mass to Fornax, at a distance of 16 kpc from the
Galactic Centre, is \~0.5 kpc. As Sagittarius extends over at least 3
kpc, almost an order of magnitude larger than the tidal limit, it
provides us with a snapshot of an early phase of the tidal destruction
of a satellite galaxy."*

### Sarajedini & Layden 1995

*"We present V7 CCD color-magnitude diagrams for the globular cluster
M54 and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These are used to derive the
following quantities: \[Fe/H\]=-1.79±0.08 for M54 and
\[Fe/H\]=-0.52±0.09 for Sagittarius. We find a metallicity dispersion of
±0.16 dex in M54, and we infer the possible existence of a \[Fe/H\] \~
-1.3 component in Sagittarius, which may have a metallicity dispersion
as well. The mean reddening in the direction of M54 is E(B-V) =0.13
±0.02. The distances to M54 and Sagittarius, determined using their
horizontal branch magnitudes, are identical to within the uncertainties
of existing RR Lyrae luminosity-abundance relations. This, together with
positional and radial velocity arguments, suggests that M54 is
physically associated with Sagittarius. We note that M54 is
substantially brighter than the globular cluster members of the Fornax
dwarf spheroidal galaxy, and that the metal abundance of Sagittarius is
quite high for its estimated absolute magnitude."*

*"metallicity dispersion of ±0.16±0.01 dex in M54. This result should be
confirmed by high-quality spectroscopic abundance measurements."*

*"we conjecture that the (mysterious) RHB represents some older or more
metal-poor population, as compared with the Sgr red clump stars. \[..\]
the dominant population in Sgr has an age of \^10 Gyr, which is
consistent with a red clump HB morphology at \[Fe/H\]\^-0.5 and a red HB
at \[Fe/H\]\^-1.3.".*

*"it seems quite likely that M54 is itself a part of the Sgr dwarf
galaxy. Perhaps it represents the oldest, most metal-poor, epoch of star
formation in Sgr, essentially the nucleus about which the rest of the
galaxy condensed. This raises the question of whether Sgr is a nucleated
dwarf galaxy. However, the colors of these nuclei are usually very
similar to that of the surrounding dwarf field stars, whereas M54
appears considerably bluer than the surrounding Sgr field. Thus, M54 is
likely to be a more luminous version of Fornax-like globulars, rather
than a galactic nucleus."*

*"Clearly, (Sgr) its high abundance for its luminosity'*

### Da Costa, G. S.; Armandroff, T. E. 1995

*"we find \[Fe/H\]= --- 2.00±0.08, -0.67±0.07, -1.28±0.12, -0.36±0.09,
-1.70±0.11, -1.55±0.10, and ---1.99±0.08 for Pal 15, NGC 6366, NGC 6626
(M28), Terzan 7, Arp 2, NGC 6715 (M54), and Terzan 8, respectively."*

*"We note also that four of the clusters studied here (M54, Terzan 7,
Arp 2, and Terzan 8) have locations in the sky, radial velocities, and
distances that associate them with the recently discovered Sagittarius
dwarf spheroidal galaxy."*

*"We note also that the Sagittarius cluster system, if integrated into
the galactic halo, will*

*contribute clusters to both the younger halo and old halo subsamples."*

*"In these studies Ter 7 is found to be significantly younger than the
globular cluster 47 Tue, by perhaps as much as 4 Gyr. \[..\] Terzan 7 is
clearly kinematically and spatially a halo object, despite its high
abundance. It then becomes the third such metal-rich halo cluster, after
NGC 6366 (Da Costa & Seitzer 1989; Sec. 4.1.5 below) and Pal 12 (Sec.
4.1.8 below), to be identified. \[..\] This is not an unexpected result;
for example, based on Gaussian fits to the overall cluster abundance
distribution, Armandroff & Zinn (1988) estimated that approximately one
halo cluster lay above the abundance cut. It does indicate however, that
perhaps ---3% of the Galaxy's halo cluster system is relatively metal
rich. Field halo stars with abundances comparable to NGC 6366 and Ter 7
are also known (e.g., Carney et al. 1990; Ryan, private communication)
but whether these metal-rich field halo stars exist in the same relative
proportion as the metal-rich halo clusters remains an open question at
present. In this context it is also interesting to note that the field
star members of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy are relatively metal rich
\[mean abundance \[Fe/H\]= ---1.0±0.3 from the spectroscopic
measurements of Ibata et al. (1994); -1.1 ±0.3 from isochrone fitting to
the color-magnitude diagram by Mateo et al. (1995); -0.52±0.09 from
giant branch fits in a CM diagram by Sarajedini & Layden (1995)\].
Consequently, when, or indeed if, this dwarf galaxy is fully disrupted
and integrated into the Galaxy's halo, it will contribute a population
of what will be recognized only as relatively metal-rich stars with halo
kinematics."*

### Bassino, L. P.; Muzzio, J. C. 1995

M54: GC or nucleus of Sgr?

Against: too blue, too metal poor.

In favour: very luminous (comparable to the Fornax nucleus). If Sgr is a
non-nucleated dwarf, it shouldn't survive longer than 5.5 Gyr. It's
brightness is comparable to omega-cent (the authors toy with the idea
that perhaps omega-cent was the nucleus of a now totally disrupted dwarf
galaxy).

### Ibata, Rodrigo A.; Gilmore, Gerard; Irwin, Michael J. 1995

"*We have discovered a new Galactic satellite galaxy in the
constellation of Sagittarius. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy subtends an
angle of - 10° on the sky, lies at a distance of 24 kpc and is
comparable in size and luminosity to the largest dwarf spheroidal,
Fornax. The new galaxy has many features in common with the other eight
Galactic dwarf spheroidal systems, including an extended low-density
spatial structure, a well populated red horizontal branch with a blue
extension, and a substantial carbon star population. In terms of stellar
populations it most closely resembles the Fornax dwarf, having a strong
intermediate-age stellar component and evidence of a metallicity spread.
Sagittarius is the nearest galaxy known and currently lies only - 16 kpc
from the centre of the Milky Way. Isodensity maps show it to be markedly
elongated along a direction pointing towards the Galactic Centre, and
suggest that it has been tidally distorted. The close proximity to the
Galactic Centre, the morphological appearance and the radial velocity of
140 km s\"1 indicate that this system must have undergone at most very
few close orbital encounters with the Milky Way. It is currently
undergoing strong tidal disruption prior to being integrated into the
Galaxy. We find that at least some of the four globular clusters, M54,
Arp 2, Ter 7 and Ter 8, are associated with the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy, and will probably share the fate of their progenitor. The
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy was found serendipitously using a combination
of UK Schmidt Telescope sky survey plates, the APM automatic plate
measuring facility and the Anglo-Australian Telescope multifibre
spectrograph, AUTOFIB."*

*"The hypothesis that the unknown population is part of a spiral arm
close to the Galactic Centre solves some of the problems inherent in the
above disc hypothesis. The narrow line-of-sight depth implied by the
small magnitude spread of the excess feature near R = 17.7, and the low
velocity dispersion is consistent with seeing a spiral arm approximately
edge-on." \[..\] "but note that some situations, such as a tightly wound
spiral arm or that depicted in Fig. 19, can be ruled out".*

They discard this hypothesis, or at least it is not very likely.

### Mateo et al. 1995a

We present deep CCD photometry of a field in the newly discovered dwarf
spheroidal galaxy in Sagittarius (hereafter Sgr), and of a nearby
control field. These data were used to produce color-magnitude (CM)
diagrams reaching I \~ 22.3 in both fields. After statistically removing
the field stars from the CM diagram we find that Sgr is dominated by a
moderately old (age \~10 Gyr) population, significantly younger than a
typical globular-cluster population. There is some evidence for a weak
intermediate-age component or alternatively a population of blue
stragglers. These results confirm that Sgr is a bona fide dwarf
spheroidal galaxy, the ninth found orbiting the Milky Way. We have
discovered nine short-period variables in the Sgr field, well in excess
of the number found in the control field. Seven of these stars have
similar apparent magnitudes and are almost certainly RR Lyr stars in
Sgr. We have used the minimum-light colors of the RRab variables to
determine the reddening of the Sgr field to be E(V-I) = 0.22, or E(B-V)
= 0.18 for a normal extinction law. For an assumed RR Lyr luminosity of
M_v\_ = +0.6 we conclude that the distance of Sgr is 25.2+/-2.8 kpc. The
properties of the Sgr giant branch and upper main sequence are
consistent with a mean metallicity of \[Fe/H\]\~ -1.1+/-0.3.

### Mateo et al. 1995b

We present time-series CCD photometry of a field in the newly discovered
dwarf spheroidal galaxy in Sagittarius (hereafter Sgr), and of a nearby
control field. These data, which consist of VI images obtained during
the 1994 OGLE season, were used to identify and study variable stars in
both fields. We discovered ten variable stars in the Sgr field, nine of
which have light curves and periods consistent with RR Lyr stars or
anomalous Cepheids. The control field contains four short-period contact
eclipsing binaries, but no pulsating variables. The variables in the Sgr
field include a bright RR Lyr star that is almost certainly located in
front of Sgr in the galactic bulge, a short-period contact binary
located near or within Sgr, and a short-period pulsating star that may
either be a foreground halo RR Lyr star or an anomalous Cepheid within
Sgr. The seven remaining variables in the Sgr field are RR Lyr stars
with very similar mean apparent magnitudes; we conclude that they are
members of Sgr. We estimate the total number of RR Lyr stars in Sgr to
be 1930+730 if M_v,sgr\_ = -13, or 310+/-120 if M_v,sgr\_ = -11. The
frequency of pulsating variables in Sgr is consistent with earlier
conclusions that the galaxy consists of a predominant old (age \~\> 10
Gyr) population.

### Mateo et al. 1996

They find Sgr material (based on photometry) 10deg away from the
progenitor.

*"Either the stellar surface density in Sgr is remarkably uniform -the
densities at radial distances of 4deg and 9.7deg (w.r.t. M54) are nearly
identical- or the outer structure of Sgr is very clumpy. The latter
conclusion is interesting because most tidal disruption models do not
predict significant clumpiness as a satellite is torn apart."*

They try to understand the material as being part of the normal dwarf (I
think) but at 10deg it is the transition from dwarf to tidal tails.
Could this explain their "equal density" problem?

### Alard 1996

They find 313 RR Lyrae clustered at a distance of \~24kpc in a 25 deg\^2
field centred at l,b = 3,-7 deg (8 deg away from M54). They report then
that these stars are too far based on the iso-contours of IGI94.

### Fahlman et al. 1996

They find main sequence stars of Sgr close in the sky to M55 (l,b = 8,
-23 deg). They use isochrone fitting to say that the age of Sgr is
\>10Gyr, similar to the ages of Ter.7 and Arp 2.

### Whitelock, Irwin and Catchpole 1996

Near-infrared photometry is presented of 75 late-type giants in the
direction of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. 71 of these are thought to be
members of the galaxy; the other four are late-type M stars in the
Bulge. The carbon stars and possible carbon stars have a wide range of
properties. The reddest ones are similar to carbon stars in Fornax,
while the bluest are more like those in Sculptor, Draco and Ursa Minor.
A clearly defined giant branch indicates a metallicity slightly weaker
than that of 47 Tuc and a value of \[Fe/H\] − 0.8 is estimated. The most
luminous star which is a confirmed member of the dwarf galaxy is a
carbon star with Mbol \~ −4.5. Four variable stars have been discovered;
these are probably of the semi-regular and/or Mira type with periods of
the order of 150 to 300 days.

### Zijlstra and Walsh 1996

Two planetary nebulae are shown to belong to the Sagittarius Dwarf
Galaxy, on the basis of their radial velocities. This is only the second
dwarf spheroidal galaxy, after Fornax, found to contain planetary
nebulae. Their existence confirms that this galaxy is at least as
massive as the Fornax dwarf spheroidal which has a single planetary
nebula, and suggests a mass of a few times 107 M. The two planetary
nebulae are located along the major axis of the galaxy, near the base of
the tidal tail. There is a further candidate, situated at a very large
distance along the direction of the tidal tail, for which no velocity
measurement is available. The location of the planetary nebulae and
globular clusters of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy suggests that a
significant fraction of its mass is contained within the tidal tail.

*"Mateo et al. suggested that the enlarged extent is more easily
explained if the galaxy has already undergone an earlier encounter with
the Galaxy which produced a long tidal tail (Piatek & Pryor 1995)
extending on both the leading and trailing side (Moore & Davis 1994."*

### Alcock et al. 1996

We report the discovery of 30 type a,b RR Lyrae (RRab) which are likely
members of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy. Accurate positions,
periods, amplitudes and magnitudes are presented. Their distances are
determined with respect to RRab in the Galactic bulge found also in the
MACHO 1993 data. For R⊙ = 8 kpc, the mean distance to these stars is D =
22 ± 1 kpc, smaller than previous determinations for this galaxy. This
indicates that Sgr has an elongated main body extending for more than 10
kpc, which is inclined along the line of sight, with its northern part
(in Galactic coordinates) closer to us. The size and shape of Sgr give
clues about the past history of this galaxy. If the shape of Sgr follows
the direction of its orbit, the observed spatial orientation suggests
that Sgr is moving away from the Galactic plane. Also, Sgr stars may be
the sources of some of the microlensing events seen towards the bulge.

### Ibata et al. 1997

The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, the closest satellite galaxy of
the Milky Way has survived for many orbits about the Galaxy. Extant
numerical calculations modeled this galaxy as a system with a
centrally-concentrated mass profile, following the light, and found that
it should lose more than one-half of its mass every 2--4 orbits and be
completely disrupted long before now. Apparently the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal, and by implication other dSph galaxies, do not have a
centrally concentrated profile for their dark matter. We develop a model
in which the stars of the Sgr dwarf are embedded in a constant-density
dark matter halo, representing the core of a tidally-limited system, and
show that this is consistent with its survival. We present new
photometric and kinematic observations of the Sagittarius dwarf

spheroidal and show these data are consistent with this explanation for
the continued existence of this galaxy. The Sagittarius dwarf is being
tidally distorted and is tidally limited, but is not disrupted as yet.
The corresponding minimum total mass is 10\^9 M⊙, while the central mass
to visual light ratio ∼ 50 in Solar units.

Our new photographic photometry allows the detection of main-sequence
stars of the Sagittarius dwarf over an area of 22◦ × 8◦. The Sagittarius
dwarf is prolate, with axis ratios ∼ 3:1:1. For an adopted distance of
16 ± 2 kpc from the Galactic center on the opposite side of the Galaxy
to the Sun, the major axis is ∼> 9 kpc long and is aligned approximately
normal to the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy, roughly following the
coordinate line ℓ = 5◦.

The central velocity dispersion of giant stars which are members of the
Sagittarius dwarf is 11.4 ± 0.7 km s−1 and is consistent with being
constant over the face of the galaxy. The gradient in mean line-of-sight
velocity with position along the major axis, dv/db, is ∼ 0 km s−1/degree
in the central regions and increases in amplitude to dv/db = −3 km
s−1/degree over the outermost three degrees for which we have data. A
first measurement of the proper motion of Sgr determines the component
of its space velocity parallel to its major axis to be 250 ± 90 km s−1 ,
directed towards the Galactic Plane. We model these kinematic data to
determine the orbit of the Sagittarius dwarf. Our best fit model has an
orbital period of ∼\< 1 Gyr and has the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal
close to perigalacticon. This period is shorter, by about a factor of
\>∼ 10, than the age of the bulk of its stellar population.

*"A robust conclusion, consistent with both analyses of globular cluster
ages, is that an RR Lyrae population can occur in stellar systems with
metallicities ∼ −1.5 dex that are as much as ∼ 5 Gyr younger than the
classical old halo. Thus the detection of RR Lyrae stars in the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal is indicative of a population of age
greater than ∼ 10 − 12 Gyr."*

*"The mass of the Sagittarius dwarf is not important for constraining
the orbit, provided it is low enough that dynamical friction has not
substantially modified the orbit over an orbital period. This limit is 4
× 109 M⊙ at the current Galactocentric distance; we argue below that
this is satisfied."*

*"Sagittarius dwarf can be regarded as test particles which all move on
the same orbit. Numerical simulations (see §4 below) show that Galactic
tides force a satellite galaxy into a prolate shape, and at pericenter
the satellite's longest axis is aligned along its orbit. However, this
alignment with the orbit is only approximate, since the internal
self-gravity in the dwarf will act to decelerate stars that lead the
center of mass to lower energy orbits, and to accelerate stars that
trail the center of mass to higher energy orbits. The prolate dwarf is
thereby rotated about its center of mass such that the leading edge
drops towards the Galactic center (see e.g., Oh et al. 1995). However,
this is a small effect."*

*"This fit is formally acceptable (reduced χ2 = 1.7), in spite of the
systematic differences between the model and the mean velocity data. The
curvature of the data near b = −15◦ is so extreme that no orbit in the
above potential can be made to pass through the data points better than
this."*

*"Is it plausible that the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal is a rotating
body? Hargreaves et al. (1994a) found no significant rotation in the
Sextans dSph, but discovered rotation about the long (major) axis of
Ursa Minor (Hargreaves et al. 1994b). They speculated that the rotation
in the latter case was attributable to tidally-induced streaming
motions. In any case, the amplitude in UMi is a small fraction of the
internal velocity dispersion. Thus, based on the precedent of the other
dSphs, no significant internal streaming motion is expected in the
Sagittarius dwarf. It is probable that the observed mean velocity is
correctly representing that which is appropriate to determine the orbit
of Sgr about the Galaxy. Nonetheless, we consider as a limiting case the
possibility that the Sagittarius dwarf is flattened entirely by internal
streaming, and that streaming is oriented so as to have the maximum
possible effect on the observed mean stellar velocities. \[..\] We
assume (maximally) that the apparent ellipticity of Sgr is the true
ellipticity, and that the shape is determined entirely by rotation, with
no Galactic tidal contribution. Then Fig 2 in Binney (1978) indicates
that, if rotationally flattened with ellipticity q = 1 − a1/a3 ∼ 0.67,
that the maximal streaming velocity in the Sagittarius dwarf is
approximately equal to its velocity dispersion. For consistency with the
model developed below, we further assume that Sgr rotates with a solid
body rotation curve about a point near M54. In that case, the maximum
rotation velocity corresponds to \|Ωrot\| ∼\< 1 km/s/degree. \[..\] None
of the models with major axis rotation in the range −1 km/s/degree \<
Ωrot \< 1 km/s/degree fits the curvature in the velocity curve near b =
−15◦ evident in Fig 10."*

*"We note here that it is implausible that the Sagittarius dwarf has
been recently captured by the Milky Way. For this to have happened, a
non-destructive encounter of Sgr with a rather massive companion galaxy
is required to perturb its orbit sufficiently. The apocenter we have
derived is similar to the current distance of the Large Magellanic
Cloud, but the current constraints on the orbit of the LMC (Jones,
Klemola & Lin 1994) are not consistent with such a scenario."*

*"The internal velocity dispersion in the satellite does not change
significantly prior to disruption (the dispersion may in fact decrease
during disruption) and the stellar surface density distribution remains
well described by a King model until near total disruption \[..\] Piatek
& Pryor found that, generically, the dwarf spheroidal is stretched along
its orbit and compressed in the perpendicular directions."*

*"Velasquez & White (1995) emphasize, however, that their orbit requires
the Sgr galaxy to survive at least 10 pericentric passages before being
almost entirely disrupted on the passage immediately preceding the
present one. No mechanism to ensure the survival the Sgr dwarf prior to
its current orbit is discussed. \[..\] These simulations concluded that
the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal should be rather easily disrupted,
leading to the conundrum of its age being an order of magnitude greater
than its predicted lifetime."*

[Apparently, at this point, everyone had problems keeping the Sgr
remnant alive for so long. Is this because they were considering many
orbits? Is this ok with just having 3 pericentres?]{.underline}

*"We propose below that the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal is being
tidally stretched along its major axis, which is aligned with its orbit,
and is presently tidally limited. We present a self-consistent model
with these properties."*

Basically, they justify the robustness of Sgr with it having a large DM
core that remained untouched. That increases the mass estimate from only
light, and shields it. Is this necessary still?

***"Following Ostriker (1990), the absolute maximum amount of energy
that could be imparted to the disk is the total orbital energy of the
satellite, giving an increase of random energy of disk stars of ∆v\^2 ∼
v\^2 orbit MSgr/Mdisk, which is ∆v\^2 ∼ 250\^2 × 10−2 (MSgr/10\^9 )(5 ×
10\^10/Mdisk) ∼ (45km/s)\^2 . If all of this energy could be put into
vertical heating, and the initial disk has σz ∼ 20 km/s dispersion, this
would be increased to ∼ 50 km/s. Of course this is a highly unlikely
event --- the energy absorbed by the disk would be spread among its
internal degrees of freedom, even neglecting the internal degrees of
freedom of the satellite, and of the dark halo and the dissipation of
gas. Binney (1992) has reviewed the role that accretion may play in the
generation and sustaining of warps in disks. The mass that we have
derived for the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal is sufficiently high to
suggest a role in the generation of the Milky Way warp, as suggested by
Lin et al. (1996)."***

***"We argue that dynamical friction will not have induced significant
orbital decay, and that it is unlikely that the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal has been captured recently, so it has apparently survived
many perigalacticon passages. \[..\] Thus, the measured velocity
dispersion is a clear indication that the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal
did not have a much more massive progenitor. Furthermore, if it had been
significantly more massive in the past, we would expect to find its
'missing mass' as a substantial population of Sagittarius dwarf debris
--- globular clusters and stars --- along its dispersion orbit; however,
this is not observed."***

*"The numerical calculations summarized in Sec. 4 below show that the
effect of Galactic tides on a dwarf spheroidal is to generate
flattening, and to orient the dwarf spheroidal such that its major axis
is aligned along its orbit, at least near perigalacticon for elliptical
orbits. That is, a tidally-distorted dSph galaxy is effectively a bar
which is spin-orbit locked near perigalacticon."*

### Ng & Schultheis 1997:

A catalogue is presented with variable (RR Lyrae, semiregular and Mira)
stars located inside field #3 of the Palomar-Groningen Survey at the
outer edge of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. One of the semiregular
variables is a carbon star, comparable with those found by Azzopardi et
al. (1991). Serendipity provides the suggestion that their carbon stars
might not be located inside, but behind the bulge in the Sagittarius
dwarf galaxy.

### Layden & Sarajedini 1997:

We present a deep color-magnitude diagram in the V I passbands of the
globular cluster M54, a member of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The data
extend below the cluster's main sequence turn-off, allowing us to
estimate the cluster's age. We find that M54 is 0.5--1.5 gigayears older
than the Galactic globulars M68 and M5. In absolute terms, the age is
comparable to the published age estimates of the other member clusters
Arp 2 and Terzan 8, but is significantly older than the member cluster
Terzan 7. An age estimate of the Sagittarius field population relative
to M54 suggests that M54 is ∼>3 Gyr older than the field. We discuss
briefly the star formation history of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.

*"M54 has an age typical of Galactic globulars of its metallicity.
\[..\] Comparing our absolute age for M54 with the age estimates for the
dominant Sgr field population shown in Table 1 suggests that M54 is
older than the metal-rich field population in which it is embedded."*

***"As was the case for many of the Galactic satellite dwarf spheroidals
(e.g., Smecker-Hane et al. 1994), Sgr managed to retain a significant
portion of its gas for many Gyr, enabling the formation of*** ***Ter 7,
and of the ∼4 Gyr field population."***

### Walsh et al. 1997

"An abundance analysis is presented for both PN using empirical
abundance determinations. The abundance pattern is very similar in both
nebulae and both show an oxygen depletion of −0.4 dex with respect to
the mean oxygen abundance of Galactic planetary nebulae and \[O/H\] =
−0.6 . The Sagittarius PN progenitor stars are representative of the
higher metallicity tail of the Sagittarius population. The pattern of
abundance depletion is similar to that in the only other planetary
nebula in a dwarf galaxy companion of the Milky Way, that in Fornax, for
which new spectra are presented. However the abundances are larger than
for Galactic halo PN suggesting a later formation age. The oxygen
abundance of the Sagittarius galaxy deduced from its PN, shows
similarities with that of dwarf ellipticals around M 31, advancing the
notion that this galaxy was a dwarf elliptical before its interaction
with the Milky Way."

### Marconi et al. 1997:

We present V,I deep CCD photometry for three fields of the dwarf galaxy
in Sagittarius (Sgr), located at l=5.6, b=-14.1. One of the fields is
centered on the globular cluster NGC 6715 (M54), which lies in one of
the dense clumps of the Sgr galaxy. Comparing the CMD of Sgr with those
of globular clusters which are believed to be kinematically associated
with the dwarf galaxy (Da Costa & Armandroff, 1995), we conclude that
the stellar population of Sgr presents a spread in metallicity of -0.71
≤\[Fe/H\] ≤-1.58, and that the dominant population (≃10 Gyr old) is
extremely similar to the star content of the associated globular cluster
Terzan 7. The estimated distance to Sgr is d≃24.55 Kpc.

NOTE: again, another mention to Ter.7 being formed from gas similar to
that of the stars in Sgr. In this case, it seems inconsistent with
previous papers. Terzan 7 mean metalicity is -0.32 dex ([[LEAMAN
2012]{.underline}](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/144/6/183)),
cannot be 10 Gyr old. Current estimates put it at \~8 Gyr (Geisler
2007).

### Montegriffo et al. 1998:

We present deep V- and I-band CCD photometry of the globular cluster
Terzan8, recently found to be a member of the globular cluster system of
the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We accurately estimate the
metallicity of Terzan8, and provide the first direct determination of
the colour excess toward this cluster. Our robust age estimate confirms
that this cluster is indeed coeval with typical Galactic globulars of
comparable metal content, and thus it is probably significantly older
than at least two other Sagittarius clusters, Terzan7 and Arp2. The
implications of this result on the star formation history of the
Sagittarius galaxy are briefly discussed.

### Smith et al. 1998:

We plot the globular clusters of the Fornax galaxy and those associated
with the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the horizontal-branch
type versus metallicity diagram. The horizontal-branch types for the
Fornax clusters include corrections for red horizontal-branch stars from
the field and are based on our recent work and new results in the
literature. Fornax globular clusters continue to stand out as having red
horizontal branches for their low (\[Fe/H\]D \[2) metallicities, with no
counterparts in either the outer Galactic halo or the Magellanic Clouds.
The clusters associated with Sagittarius lie to the blue of the Fornax
clusters, except for the metal-rich cluster Ter 7. Although the
metallicities of the three metal-poor Sagittarius globular clusters are
similar to those of the Fornax clusters, their horizontal branches are
bluer and they lie in a region also populated by the old LMC and old
halo clusters. Neither cluster system resembles the younger Galactic
halo globular clusters, often suggested to have been accreted from
disrupted dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Except for Ter 7, both the Fornax
and Sagittarius globular clusters are metal-poor compared with their
Galactic counterparts of the same horizontal-branch type. We Ðnd no
correlation between HB type and other cluster properties such as central
concentration, luminosity, central surface brightness, and estimated
collision rate.

"M54 might have captured stars from the Sgr dwarf, and the shadow RGB
and some of the blue horizontal-branch stars could have been acquired in
this way. We note the large mass of M54 (10\^6 Msun; Illingworth 1976)
and its membership in the Sgr dwarf, which is experiencing tidal
disruption by the Milky Way. (Note that the central velocity dispersion
of the Sgr dwarf of 11.4 km/s \[Ibata et al. 1997\] Bica (1997), is less
than that of M54, 14 km/s.) seeking to explain a metal-rich RGB in the
metal-poor cluster HP 1, show that globular clusters in the bulge could
capture stars. Alternatively, if Sgr experienced multiple bursts of star
formation, it is possible that some stars formed bound to M54."

### Ng 1998:

The photometric estimate of the metallicity and the age of the Azzopardi
et al. (\\cite{ALRW91}) carbon stars (Ng \\cite{Ng97}) is revised to
respectively Zem =\~ em0.004 and \~ em0.1 Gyr. Under the hypothesis that
the carbon stars are located at a distance related to the Sagittarius
dwarf galaxy, the broad velocity dispersion of the stars can only be
explained if they were formed out of Galactic material during a recent
crossing of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy through the Galactic plane.

### van den Bergh 1998:

The possibility that the **Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal might have
formed as a Searle-Zinn fragment in the outer halo of the Galaxy** is
discussed. Arguments in favor of this hypothesis are (1) the luminosity
distribution of globular clusters in both Sagittarius and in the outer
halo (Rgc>80 kpc) appear to be bimodal with peaks near Mv\~-5 and -10,
and (2) the globular clusters in both Sgr and the outer halo have a
significantly larger age spread than do the globulars in the inner halo
of the Galaxy. However, a counterargument is that only one of the four
globulars associated with Sgr has the large half-light diameter that is
diagnostic of outer halo clusters. The absence of globular clusters from
all Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies fainter than Mv=-12 shows that
their specific globular cluster frequency must be lower than it is in
the Fornax dwarf spheroidal. This result suggests that Fornax may have
had an unusual evolutionary history.

Searle-Zinn fragment (Searle & Zinn 1978): *"It is suggested that the
halo clusters originated within transient protogalactic fragments that
gradually lost gas while undergoing chemical evolution and continued to
fall into the Galaxy after the collapse of its central regions had been
completed."*

This would imply something similar to monolithic collapse, which is
mostly disfavoured.

### Mateo et al. 1998:

We have obtained deep photometric data in 24 fields along the southeast
extension of the major axis of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr
dSph) galaxy and in four fields along the northwest extension. Using
star counts at the expected position of the Sgr upper main sequence
within the resulting color-magnitude diagrams, we unambiguously detect
Sgr stars in the southeast over the range 10°-34° from the galaxy\'s
center. If Sgr is symmetric, this implies a true major-axis diameter of
at least 68°, or nearly 30 kpc if all portions of Sgr are equally
distant from the Sun. Star counts parallel to the galaxy\'s minor axis
reveal that Sgr remains quite broad far from its center. This suggests
that the outer portions of Sgr resemble a stream rather than an
extension of the ellipsoidal inner regions of the galaxy. The inferred
V-band surface brightness (SB) profile ranges from 27.3 to 30.5 mag
arcsec-2 over this radial range and exhibits a change in slope \~20°
from the center of Sgr. The scale length of the outer SB profile is
17.2d, compared with 4.7d in the central region of Sgr. We speculate
that this break in the SB profile represents a transition from the main
body of Sgr to a more extended \`\`Sgr stream.\'\' By integrating the SB
profile, we estimate that the absolute visual magnitude of Sgr lies in
the range -13.4 to -14.6, depending on the assumed structure of Sgr; an
upper limit to the luminosity of Sgr is therefore L\~5.8×107 Lsolar.
**This result lowers the M/LV ratio inferred for Sgr down to \~10, which
is consistent with values observed in the most luminous dSph companions
of the Milky Way.**

*"The Sgr main sequence turnoff occurs at I0 ∼ 20 mag and (V−I) ∼ 0.6
(Mateo et al. 1996; Fahlman et al. 1996; Figure 2). By good fortune,
this corresponds to a gap in the density of contaminating foreground
stars from the thin disk (located at I0 ∼ \< 20 in this color range) and
background galaxies that populate the prominent 'blob' in Figure 2
fainter than I0 ∼ 22.5 at this color."*

NOTE: first actual detection of the stream.

### Whitelock et al. 1999:

The luminosities of carbon stars in the Sagittarius Dwarf are derived
from infrared photometry and compared with those of carbon stars in
other galaxies. Several of them are large amplitude, probably Mira,
variables and one shows obscuration episodes characteristic of galactic
carbon stars with moderate mass-loss rates, e.g. R For and R Lep.
**These variables are more like those found in the Magellanic Clouds
than in dwarf spheroidals.**

### Bellazzini et al. 1999:

We present the first results of a large photometric survey devoted to
the study of the star formation history of the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph). Three wide strips (size \~ 9 x 35 arcmin
\^2) located at \~ (l deg b deg) = (6.5;-16), (6;-14), (5;-12) have been
observed. Each strip is roughly east-west oriented, nearly along the
major axis of the galaxy. A control field (size \~ 9 x 24 arcmin \^2),
located outside the body of Sgr dSph \[\~ (l deg b deg) = (354;-14)\]
has also been observed for statistical decontamination purposes.
Accurate and well-calibrated V, I photometry down to V \~ 22 has been
obtained for \~ **90 000 stars** towards the Sgr dSph and \~ 8000 stars
in the control field. This is the largest photometric sample (covering
the widest spatial extension) ever observed in the Sgr dSph up to now.
The main new results presented in this paper are: (1) **the possible
discovery of a strong asymmetry in the distribution of stars along the
major axis, since the north-western arm of the Sgr galaxy (i.e. the
region nearer to the Galactic bulge) apparently shows a significant
deficiency of Sgr stars** and (2) the first direct detection of a very
metal-poor (and presumably old) population in the Sgr stellar content.
**Hints at a metallicity gradient towards the densest region of the
galaxy are also reported.**

"The simultaneous presence of a clear sequence of blue stars (blue
plume, see below) and carbon stars has been interpreted as evidence for
the presence of a sparse population of stars significantly younger than
Pop A (MUSKKK; WIC; Layden & Sarajedini 1997, hereafter LS97). Let us
call this component Pop B, for brevity. The estimates of the absolute
age of Pop B range from 4 (MUSKKK) to 1 Gyr (Ng 1997). \[..\] There are
at least two (of the four) globular clusters associated with Sgr that
are very metal-poor (Fe/H\~-2) and significantly older than Pop A, i.e.
M54 (MAL; LS97) and Terzan 8 (MoAL). This fact, coupled with the
presence of RR Lyrae stars, suggests the existence of an old and
metal-poor population in the galaxy. **However, a direct identification
of such a component is still missing.**"

"Density distribution asymmetry along the major axis: The SGRWEST region
(nearer to the Galactic bulge and the leading head of Sgr along its
orbit, according to IGWIS) seems significantly deficient of Sgr stars
with respect to SGR34. If this result is exact, it would be very
difficult to find a physical mechanism other than tidal interaction with
the Galaxy that can produce such an asymmetry in the density
distribution of Sgr stars, also given the remarkable homogeneity of the
stellar content. So, it can be considered as a clue suggesting that the
tidal disruption of the Sgr galaxy is currently going on."

"Pop A and Pop B stars have similar distributions: if the stars in the
blue plume identified in the CMDs are associated with a younger
population (Pop B) it must be concluded that (a) both episodes of star
formation (Pop A and Pop B) occurred on large scales, comparable with
the dimension of the galaxy itself (i.e. stars were formed everywhere
nearly at the same epoch), or (b) a very efficient mechanism for star
mixing has been at work in Sgr. The two-body relaxation time for this
system is, as expected, much greater than one Hubble time for any
reasonable assumption about the structure of the galaxy, so hypothesis
(a) seems the most likely."

### Burton & Lockman 1999:

We have measured the λ21 cm line of Galactic Hi over more than 50 square
degrees in the direction of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The
data show **no evidence of HI associated with the dwarf spheroidal**
which might be considered analogous to the Magellanic Stream as it is
associated in both position and velocity with the Large Magellanic
Cloud. **Nor do the HI data show evidence for any disturbance in the
Milky Way disk gas that can be unambiguously assigned to interaction
with the dwarf galaxy**. The data shown here limit the Hi mass at the
velocity of the Sagittarius dwarf to \< 7000 M⊙ over some 18 square
degrees between Galactic latitudes −13◦ and −18.◦5.

### Brown et al. 1999:

Chemical abundances in five stars in M54, a globular cluster associated
with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, have been determined using
high-resolution echelle spectra. We find the cluster to have
\[Fe/H\]=-1.55 and possibly halo-normal abundance patterns, although the
\[O/Fe\] and \[alpha/Fe\] ratios lie between solar and the normal halo
values. One star shows the combination of low oxygen and enhanced Na and
Al, symptomatic of deep mixing of ON-cycle and other proton-capture
products; a second star shows a lesser degree of O depletion
unaccompanied by Na and Al excesses. In the cluster Eu is also enhanced,
indicating that about 30% of the Ba in the cluster is due to the
r-process. In general, M54 is similar to globulars of comparable
metallicity in the inner Galactic halo, despite its clear association
with the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal.

### Majewski et al. 1999:

As part of the Selected Areas Starcounts Survey, a CCD survey to V>21,
we have obtained VI photometry of two fields at b=+/-40 deg aligned
roughly with an extrapolation of the major axis of the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal galaxy. Comparison of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for
some of these fields with the CMDs of fields reflected about the
Galactic l=0 deg meridian reveals an excess of stars at V_0=17.85 and
0.9\<(V-I)\_0\<1.1 in the (l,b)=(11 deg,-40 deg) field. The excess stars
have colors consistent with the Sgr red clump, and deeper CMD imaging in
these locations shows evidence of a main-sequence turnoff (MSTO) at
V=21, with the main sequence extending to the limit of our data (V=24).
The surface brightnesses we derive from either the potential excess of
red clump stars or the apparent excess of MSTO stars are consistent with
each other and with the results of other surveys at this latitude. No
similar excess appears in our northern Galactic hemisphere fields near
the (l, b)=(353 deg, +41 deg) field. We have obtained spectroscopy of
all 30 candidate red clump stars in the range 0.9\<(V-I)\_0\<1.1and
17.75\<V_0\<17.95. The radial velocity distribution of the stars, while
dissimilar from expectations of Galactic structure models, does not show
a contribution by stars near the Galactocentric radial velocity seen in
other studies near the Sgr core. It is difficult to reconcile a
photometric result that is consistent with other explorations of the
Sagittarius stream with a radial velocity distribution that is
apparently inconsistent. In a companion paper, we discuss how some of
the discrepancies are resolved if our potential Sgr detection
corresponds to a different Sgr tidal streamer than that detected by most
other surveys.

NOTE: farthest detection of the stream by that time, I think. Only other
is Mateo 1998 but it was closer to the dwarf by some 10deg. But
actually, M98 probably reached farther in Lambda.

### Layden and Sarajedini 2000:

We present deep VI-band photometry of the globular cluster M54, a nearby
field in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and a control field. The
color-magnitude diagrams reach well below the oldest main-sequence
turnoffs, thus enabling an analysis of the galaxy\'s age-metallicity
relation with unprecedented clarity. We also study the variable stars in
the direction of M54. From 67 RR Lyrae variables, we confirm and improve
on our previous estimates of the cluster horizontal branch magnitude,
foreground reddening, and horizontal branch morphology. These values are
used in determining the ages of M54 and the Sagittarius field
populations. We confirm our previous result that M54 is the same age as
Galactic globular clusters of similar metallicity. We also derive ages
on a self-consistent scale for the other three globular clusters in
Sagittarius. We find strong evidence for multiple episodes of star
formation (or continuous star formation with a variable rate) in the
field of Sagittarius. **We characterize the principal episodes with the
ages 11, 5, and 0.5 through 3 Gyr and with \[Fe/H\] values of -1.3,
-0.7, and -0.4, respectively**. On this scale, M54 has an age of 15 Gyr.
Surprisingly, the age-metallicity relation we have derived for the
galaxy as a whole is **described quite well by a closed-box chemical
evolution model.** We also find that the populations associated with the
Sgr field are clumped spatially around M54, and we consider several
explanations for this phenomenon. **We again speculate that Sagittarius
is a nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxy with M54 as its nucleus.**

### Cseresnjes et al. 2000:

We report the detection of \~ 1 500 RR Lyrae of Bailey type ab located
in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). These variables have been
detected on two ESO Schmidt fields centred on (l,b)=(3.1deg ,-7.1deg )
and (6.6deg ,-10.8deg ), covering an area of \~ 50 deg2. We present a
surface density map of Sgr based on the spatial distribution of these
RRab, allowing us to trace its structure in a region that was still
almost unexplored between b=-14deg and b=-4deg . We present the results
of the fit of different models to the density profile of Sgr. The best
fit to the core of Sgr is an exponential with a scale length of 4.1deg
along the major axis. **When we look at the extension of Sgr we find a
break (significant at the \~ 2sigma level) in the slope of the surface
density along the main axis of Sgr**. The nearly flat (or at least very
slowly decreasing) profile in the outer region of Sgr shows that this
dwarf galaxy is probably extending even further out our fields. Based on
observations obtained at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla,
Chile

NOTES: **The break is at b\~-9 deg and only once they corrected for the
completeness of their sample (estimated with models). In principle it
seems robust. In the V21 model, the L3p1w material seems to start more
or less there. This flattening of the density profile could be a
combination of the density profile of the remnant (goes down towards
positive Gal. lat) and that of the L3p1w material (starts at b\~-10deg
and peaks at b\~-2deg).**

### Bonifacio et al. 2000:

Two giants of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal have been observed with
the UVES spectrograph on the ESO 8.2m Kueyen telescope, during the
commissioning of the instrument. Sgr 139 has \[Fe/H\]=-0.28 and Sgr 143
\[Fe/H\]=-0.21, these values are considerably higher than photometric
estimates of the metallicity of the main population of Sgr. We derived
abundances for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Y,
Ba, La, Ce, Nd and Eu; the abundance ratios found are essentially solar
with a few exceptions: Na shows a strong overdeficiency, the heavy
elements Ba to Eu, are overabundant, while Y is underabundant. The high
metallicity derived implies that the Sgr galaxy has experienced a high
level of chemical processing. The stars had been selected to be
representative of the two main stellar populations of Sagittarius,
however, contrary to what expected from the photometry, the two stars
show a very similar chemical composition. We argue that the most likely
explanation for the difference in the photometry of the two stars is a
different distance, Sgr 143 being about 2 Kpc nearer than Sgr 139.
**This result suggests that the interpretation of colour - magnitude
diagrams of Sgr is more complex than previously thought and the effect
of the line of sight depth should not be neglected.** It also shows that
spectroscopic abundances are required for a correct interpretation of
Sgr populations. Based on public data released from the UVES
commissioning at the VLT Kueyen telescope, European Southern
Observatory, Paranal, Chile.

### Dinescu et al. 2000:

We have measured the absolute proper motion of the young globular
cluster Pal 12 with respect to background galaxies, using plate material
spanning a 40 yr time baseline, and measuring stars down to a magnitude
V\~22. The measured absolute proper motion has an uncertainty of 0.3 mas
yr-1 in each coordinate. **Pal 12\'s young age for a globular cluster
led to the hypothesis that the cluster originated in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC)** and was later captured by the Milky Way (Lin &
Richer). Here we investigate this hypothesis using the complete
kinematical data. We present the orbital characteristics of Pal 12 and
compare them with those of the LMC and Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr).
The present kinematical data suggest that, from the two parent
candidates for Pal 12, Sgr presents a more plausible case for the host
galaxy than the LMC. We explore this scenario in the context of the
uncertainties in the orbits and using two different analyses: the direct
comparison of the orbits of Pal 12 and Sgr as a function of time, and
the analytical model of Sgr\'s tidal disruption developed by Johnston.
We find that, within the present uncertainties of the observables, this
scenario is viable in both methods. Moreover, both methods place this
event at the same point in time. **Our best estimate of the time of Pal
12\'s tidal capture from Sgr is \~1.7 Gyr ago.**

NOTE: check if this is still the current understanding for Pal 12.

### Dudziak et al. 2000:

Radio continuum observations at 1.4, 4.8 and 8.6 GHz of the two
Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy reveal the
elongated shape of Wray 16-423 and the extreme compactness of He 2-436.
It is confirmed that He 2-436 is subject to local dust extinction.
Photoionization models for both PNe are obtained from two different
codes, allowing theoretical uncertainties to be assessed. Wray 16-423,
excited by a star of effective temperature 1.07\*E5 K, is an
ellipsoidal, matter-bounded nebula, except for a denser sector of solid
angle 15%. He 2-436, excited by a 7\*E4 K star, includes two
radiation-bounded shells, with the very dense, low-mass, incomplete,
inner shell possibly corresponding to a transitory event. The continuum
jump at the He+ limit (\$lambda mbda22.8 nm) agrees with NLTE model
stellar atmospheres, despite the Wolf-Rayet nature of the stars. Both
stars are on the same (H-burning) evolutionary track of initial mass
(1.2±0.1) Msolar and may be twins, with the PN ejection of Wray 16-423
having occured \~ 1500 years before He 2-436. The PN abundances
re-inforce the common origin of the parent stars, indicating almost
identical depletions with respect to solar for O, Ne, Mg, S, Cl, Ar, and
K (-0.55±0.07 dex), and strong overabundances for carbon, particularly
in He 2-436. He 2-436i lines consistently point to large identical
overabundances for helium in both PNe. An excess nitrogen makes Wray
16-423 nearly a Type I PN. **These PNe provide a means to calibrate both
metallicity and age of the stellar population of Sagittarius. They
confirm that the youngest, most metal-rich population has an age of 5
Gyr and a metallicity of \[Fe/H\]=-0.55\$, in agreement with the slope
of the red giant branch.**

### Yanny et al. 2000:

A sample of 4208 objects with magnitude 15\<g\*\<22 and colors of
main-sequence A stars have been selected from 370 deg2 of Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning observations. The data is from two long,
narrow stripes, each with an opening angle of greater than 60°, at
Galactic latitudes 36deg\<\|b\|\<63deg on the celestial equator.
Relative photometric calibrations good to 2% and consistent absolute
photometry allows this uniform sample to be treated statistically over
the large area. An examination of the sample\'s distribution shows that
these stars trace considerable substructure in the halo. Large
overdensities of A-colored stars in the north at (l, b, R)=(350deg, 50°,
46 kpc) and in the south at (157, -58, 33 kpc) and extending over tens
of degrees are present in the halo of the Milky Way. Ivezic et al. have
detected the northern structure from a sample of RR Lyrae stars in the
SDSS. Using photometry to separate the stars by surface gravity, both
structures are shown to contain a sequence of low surface gravity stars
consistent with identification as a blue horizontal branch (BHB). Both
structures also contain a population of high surface gravity stars 2 mag
fainter than the BHB stars, consistent with their identification as blue
stragglers (BSs). The majority of the high surface gravity stars in the
Galactic halo may be BS stars like these. A population of F stars
associated with the A star excess in the southern structure is detected
(the F stars in the northern structure at 46 kpc would be too faint for
the SDSS to detect). From the numbers of detected BHB stars, lower
limits to the implied mass of the structures are 6×106 Msolar and 2×106
Msolar, although one does not yet know the full spatial extent of the
structures. **The fact that two such large clumps have been detected in
a survey of only 1% of the sky indicates that such structures are not
uncommon in the halo**. Simple spheroidal parameters are fit to a
complete sample of the remaining unclumped BHB stars and yield (at r\<40
kpc) a fit to a halo distribution with flattening (c/a=0.65+/-0.2) and a
density falloff exponent of α=-3.2+/-0.3. Based on observations obtained
with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and with the Apache Point Observatory
3.5 m telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical
Research Consortium.

### Ibata et al. 2001:

Two studies have recently reported the discovery of pronounced halo
substructure in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning data.
Here we show that this halo substructure is, almost in its entirety, due
to the expected tidal stream torn off the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy
during the course of its many close encounters with the Milky Way. This
interpretation makes strong predictions on the kinematics and distances
of these stream stars. Comparison of the structure in old horizontal
branch stars, detected by the SDSS team, with the carbon star structure
discovered in our own survey, indicates that this halo stream is of
comparable age to the Milky Way. **It would appear that the Milky Way
and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy have been a strongly interacting system
for most of their existence**. Once complete, the SDSS will provide a
unique data set with which to constrain the dynamical evolution of the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy; it will also strongly constrain the mass
distribution of the outer Milky Way.

NOTE: they try to predict the signal in SDSS of the Sgr stream. Nice
plots.

### **Martinez-Delgado et al. 2001:**

Standard cosmology predicts that dwarfs were the first galaxies to be
formed in the universe and that many of them merge afterward to form
bigger galaxies such as the Milky Way. This process would have left
behind traces such as tidal debris or star streams in the outer halo. We
report here the detection of a very low density stellar system at
50+/-10 kpc from the Galactic center that could be related to the merger
process. It could form part of the Sagittarius northern stream or,
alternatively, could be the trace of a hitherto unknown dwarf galaxy.
The dwarf galaxy in Sagittarius, the closest satellite of the Milky Way,
is currently being tidally disrupted and is a \`\`living\'\' test for
galaxy formation theories. The system found here is 60° away from the
center of the Sagittarius galaxy. If it is really associated with this
galaxy, it would confirm predictions of dynamical interaction models
indicating that tidal debris from Sagittarius could extend along a
stream completely enveloping the Milky Way in a polar orbit.

**NOTE: first proper detection of the leading arm (ra\~+220 , dec\~0
deg).**

### Vivas et al. 2001:

We have measured the periods and light curves of 148 RR Lyrae variables
from V=13.5 to 19.7 from the first 100 deg2 of the Quasar Equatorial
Survey Team RR Lyrae survey. Approximately 55% of these stars belong to
the clump of stars detected earlier by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
According to our measurements, this feature has \~10 times the
background density of halo stars, spans at least 37.5deg by 3.5deg in α
and δ (>=30 by \>=3 kpc), lies \~50 kpc from the Sun, and has a depth
along the line of sight of \~5 kpc (1 σ). **These properties are
consistent with the recent models that suggest that it is a tidal stream
from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy**. The mean period of the
type ab variables, 0.58 days, is also consistent. In addition, we have
found two smaller overdensities in the halo, one of which may be related
to the globular cluster Pal 5.

NOTE: similar region to Martinez-Delgado et al. 2001

### Dohm-Palmer et al. 2001:

As part of the Spaghetti Project Survey, we have detected a
concentration of giant stars well above expectations for a smooth halo
model. The position (l\~350deg, b\~50deg) and distance (\~50 kpc) of
this concentration match those of the northern overdensity detected by
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. **We find additional evidence for
structure at \~80 kpc in the same direction**. We present radial
velocities for many of these stars, including the first published
results from the 6.5 m Magellan telescope. The radial velocities for
stars in these structures are in excellent agreement with models of the
dynamical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf tidal debris, whose center
is 60° away. **The metallicity of stars in these streams is lower than
that of the main body of the Sgr dwarf, which may indicate a radial
metallicity gradient prior to disruption.**

*"The SPS is a photometric and spectroscopic survey designed to identify
structure in the Galactic halo (Morrison et al. 2000). For this study,
we use the modified Washington photometric system (Canterna 1976;
Geisler 1984) to identify candidate red giants."*

*"We performed 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations of 21 stars drawn from the
smooth halo, including observational errors. The fraction of simulations
that give the observed distribution of four stars near 50 kpc with a
velocity dispersion of 32 km s1 and of two stars near 80 kpc with a
velocity dispersion 21 km s1 was 11 in 10,000."*

### Cseresnjes 2001:

We carried out a period analysis on \~ 3700 RR Lyrae stars on two
Schmidt fields centred on (l,b)=(3.1deg, -7.1deg) and (6.6deg, -10.8deg)
respectively, covering an area of \~ 50 deg2. These stars are
distributed almost evenly between the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) and
the Milky Way. For Sgr members, the average periods are \< Pab>=0.574d
and \< Pc>=0.322d for RRab and RRc stars respectively. This places Sgr
in the long-period tail of the Oosterhoff I group. We report the
detection of 53 double-mode RR Lyrae stars (RRd) within our sample. The
magnitude of 40 of these stars is consistent with membership in Sgr
whereas 13 RRds are located within our Galaxy. We also found 13 RR
Lyraes (5 in Sgr and 8 in the Galaxy) exhibiting two closely spaced
frequencies, most probably related to non-radial pulsations. The period
distribution of the RR Lyrae variables in Sgr is compared to those of
other Milky Way satellites. **We find a remarkable similarity between
the RR Lyrae populations in Sgr and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),
suggesting that these galaxies have similar horizontal branch
morphologies. This may indicate that Sgr and the LMC started their
formation under similar conditions.** **Using various photometric
indicators, we estimate the metallicity of the RR Lyrae stars in Sgr and
find \< \[Fe/H\]\> =\~ -1.6 dex with a dispersion of \~ +/-0.5 dex
around this value and a minor but significant population at ≲-2.0 dex.
We do not find evidence for a spatial metallicity gradient in the RR
Lyrae population of Sgr**. From the spatial distribution of RR Lyraes,
we find that the main body of Sgr contains \~ 4200 RRab stars. Assuming
that population gradients are negligible in Sgr, we find MV(Sgr) =\~
-13.9+0.4-0.6 mag for the main body. If Sgr has been stripped of 50% of
its mass through Galactic tides, as assumed by some models, it would
imply a total absolute magnitude of \~ -14.7 mag for this galaxy. **Such
a luminosity would be consistent with the empirical
metallicity/luminosity relation for dwarf spheroidal galaxies.**

*"\[..\] This implies that the number of RRab stars associated with Sgr
could be as high as ∼8400."*

### Cole 2001

We present the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) (J-K, K)
color-magnitude diagram for the region within 1° of the center of the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Using the slope of the red giant
branch (RGB), **we determine a mean metallicity for the main stellar
population of \[Fe/H\]=-0.5+/-0.2**. The Sagittarius RGB possesses a
blue tail that overlaps with the foreground Milky Way giant branch and
suggests that approximately one-third of the RGB is more metal-poor than
\[Fe/H\] \~ -1. Direct comparison with the Large Magellanic Cloud
confirms the metal-rich nature of the bulk of the Sagittarius
population. Our result is marginally consistent with the even higher
metallicities determined from high-resolution spectroscopy.

### Alard 2001:

Metallicity gradients in the Sagittarius dwarf Galaxy (Sgr) are
investigated by using infrared photometric data from the 2MASS survey.
To search for metallicity effects, the giant branch in a field situated
near the Center of the Sgr is compared to the giant branch in a field
situated near its southern edge. The contamination of the Sgr giant
branch by foreground Galactic stars is canceled by statistical
subtraction of diagrams symmetrical in Galactic latitude. After
subtraction it is possible to reconstruct the Sgr giant branch with
excellent accuracy. The giant branch in the two fields have similar
slopes but are shifted in color. Even after correction for the
differential reddening between the fields, the shift in color between
the branch remains, and is very significant. **This variation in the
color of the giant branch corresponds to a metallicity variation of
about -0.25 dex. The existence of a metallicity gradient in Sgr may
indicate that there are two different stellar population in Sgr. One has
low metallicity, and another one of higher metallicity has a smaller
spatial extension.**

NOTE: yet another confirmation of a metallicity gradient (which is not
seen in RR Lyrae...) apart from Dohm-Palmer+01 and Bellazzinni+99

### Newberg et al. 2002:

We identify new structures in the halo of the Milky Way from positions,
colors, and magnitudes of five million stars detected in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. Most of these stars are within 1.26d of the
celestial equator. We present color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for stars
in two previously discovered, tidally disrupted structures. The CMDs and
turnoff colors are consistent with those of the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy, as had been predicted. In one direction, we are even able to
detect a clump of red stars, similar to that of the Sagittarius dwarf,
from stars spread across 110 deg2 of sky. Focusing on stars with the
colors of F turnoff objects, we identify at least five additional
overdensities of stars. Four of these may be pieces of the same halo
structure, which would cover a region of the sky at least 40° in
diameter, at a distance of 11 kpc from the Sun (18 kpc from the center
of the Galaxy). The turnoff is significantly bluer than that of
thick-disk stars, yet the stars lie closer to the Galactic plane than a
power-law spheroid predicts. We suggest two models to explain this new
structure. One possibility is that this new structure could be a new
dwarf satellite of the Milky Way, hidden in the Galactic plane and in
the process of being tidally disrupted. The other possibility is that it
could be part of a disklike distribution of stars which is metal-poor,
with a scale height of approximately 2 kpc and a scale length of
approximately 10 kpc. The fifth overdensity, which is 20 kpc away, is
some distance from the Sagittarius dwarf streamer orbit and is not
associated with any known Galactic structure. We have tentatively
identified a sixth overdensity in the halo. If this sixth structure is
instead part of a smooth distribution of halo stars (the spheroid), then
the spheroid must be very flattened, with axial ratio q=0.5. It is
likely that there are many smaller streams of stars in the Galactic
halo.

"*Note, however, that the turnoff color of the stars in S297+63−20.0 do
not support the idea that they originated in the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy. The turnoff color also does not rule out an identification with
the Sagittarius stream; if they are associated it would imply that the
stellar populations changed along a stream"*

*"A comparison of the number of stars detected in the clump of red stars
of S341+57−22.5 and S344+58−22.5 (in the adjacent stripe 11) with the
number of similar stars in the Sagittarius dwarf indicate that we see
about 1.5% of the present stellar mass of the Sagittarius dwarf in this
110 square degree area of the sky. This result assumes a constant clump
star to stellar mass ratio between the Sagittarius dwarf and the
stream."*

### Martinez-Delgado et al. 2002:

Photometry of a large field around the young globular cluster Palomar 12
has revealed the main sequence of a low surface brightness stellar
system. This main sequence is indicative of a stellar population that
varies significantly in metallicity and/or age but in the mean is more
metal-poor than Pal 12. Under different assumptions for the properties
of this population, we find distances from the Sun in the range 17-24
kpc, which encompasses the distance to Pal 12, 19.0+/-0.9 kpc. The
stellar system is also detected in a field 2° north of Pal 12, which
indicates it has a minimum diameter of \~0.9 kpc. **The orbit of Pal 12,
the color-magnitude diagram of the stellar system, their positions on
the sky, and their distances suggest that they are debris from the tidal
disruption of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy**. We discuss
briefly the implications for the evolution of Sgr and the Galactic halo.

**NOTE: similar age to Terzan 7, but more metal poor (although other
sources put it at the same metallicity).**

### Bellazzini et al. 2002

We present the first (V,V-I) color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for the
poorly studied globular cluster NGC 5634. The CMD shows a steep red
giant branch (RGB) and a predominantly blue horizontal branch (HB): both
these characteristics suggest a low metal content for this cluster. From
the position of the RGB in the CMD we estimate \[Fe/H\]=-1.94+/-0.10 and
E(B-V)=0.06+/-0.01. The CMD presented here reaches V\~=23, allowing us
to obtain the first measure of the main-sequence turnoff (TO)
VTO=21.22+/-0.15 for this cluster. By combining this figure with the
apparent luminosity of the zero-age HB (ZAHB), VZAHB=17.90+/-0.10 we
obtain ΔVHBTO=3.32+/-0.16, a value which is fully compatible with that
derived for the bulk of Galactic globulars. We also derive a true
distance modulus of (m-M)0=17.17+/-0.12, corresponding to a distance of
\~27.2 kpc. Most interestingly, the cluster is shown to have position
and radial velocity fully compatible with the orbit of the Sagittarius
dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). **The similarity between the stellar
populations of the cluster and the Sagittarius globular Ter 8 and the
metal-poor population of the Sagittarius dSph also suggests that NGC
5634 was a former member of this disrupting galaxy, torn off by the
Galactic tidal field and now lost in the Sagittarius stream.**

NOTE: first mention to NGC 5634 as being a GC of Sgr.

### Dinescu et al. 2002

We have detected a population of predominantly blue (B-V\<=1.1) stars in
the direction l=167deg, b=-35deg (Kapteyn Selected Area \[SA\] 71) that
cannot be accounted for by standard star count models. Down to V \~ 20
mag, the colors and magnitudes of these stars are similar to those of
the southern overdensity detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
at l=167deg, b=-54deg and identified as stripped material from the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph) galaxy. **We present absolute
proper motions of the stars in SA 71, and we find that the excess blue
stars represent a distinct, kinematically cooler component than the
Galactic field, in reasonable agreement with predictions of Sgr dSph
disruption models.** The density of the excess SA 71 stars at V\~18.8
mag and B-V\<=1.1 is within a factor of 2 of the density of the
SDSS-south Sgr dSph stripped material and of that predicted by the Helmi
& White disruption model. Three additional anticenter fields (SA 29, 45,
and 118) show very good agreement with standard star count models.

### Kundu et al. 2002:

We describe first results of a spectroscopic probe of selected fields
from the Grid Giant Star Survey (GGSS). Multifiber spectroscopy of
several hundred stars in a strip of 11 fields along δ\~-17deg, in the
range 12 hr\<\~α\<\~17 hr, reveals a group of eight giants that have
kinematical characteristics differing from the main field population but
that as a group maintain coherent, smoothly varying distances and radial
velocities with position across the fields. Moreover, these stars have
roughly the same abundance, according to their MgH+Mgb absorption line
strengths. Photometric parallaxes place these stars in a semiloop
structure, arcing in a contiguous distribution between 5.7 and 7.9 kpc
from the Galactic center. The spatial, kinematical, and abundance
coherence of these stars suggests that they are part of a diffuse stream
of tidal debris, and one roughly consistent with a wrapped, leading
tidal arm of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy.

"*The proposed stream is most consistent with the debris stripped from
Sgr "two passages ago."*

NOTES: The data (8 giants) does not match in any way current models
(V21) whereas it seems more consistent with the tails of their sample
(Their fig. 1). Their 8 stars are in all sorts of distances, from 1kpc
to 10 kpc from the Sun. Too close.

### Monaco et al. 2002:

We present V, I photometry of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal
galaxy for a region of \~1deg×1deg, centered on the globular cluster
M54. This catalog is the largest database of stars **(\~493,000)** ever
obtained for this galaxy. The wide area covered allows us to measure for
the first time the position of the red giant branch (RGB) bump, a
feature that has been identified in most Galactic globular clusters and
only recently in a few galaxies of the Local Group. The presence of a
single-peaked bump in the RGB differential luminosity function confirms
that there is a dominant population in Sgr (Pop A). The photometric
properties of the Pop A RGB and **the position of the** **RGB bump have
been used to constrain the range of possible ages and metallicities of
this population. The most likely solution lies in the range
-0.6\<\[M/H\]\<=-0.4 and 4 Gyr\<=age\<=8 Gyr.**

"*The RGB-bump magnitude is mainly driven by the metal content and, to a
lesser extent, by the age of the population."*

*"The physical origin of the RGB-bump is well known: in the stellar
interior during the first ascent of the giant branch, the H-burning
shell is moving constantly outwards until it reaches the discontinuity
in the H radial profile, left by the innermost penetration of the
convective envelope inside the star. At the discontinuity, the
luminosity of the star drops for a while, until the shell adapts to the
new environment, and then it rises again in a regime of constant H
content. Observationally, the RGB-bump appears as a peak in the
differential luminosity function (LF), due to the non-monotonic
evolution of the star in luminosity. It appears also as a jump and a
change in slope of the integrated LF, due to the change in the
evolutionary rate, caused by the sudden change of molecular weight of
the material in which the H-burning shell is moving. According to Fusi
Pecci et al. (1990), the change in the slope of the integrated
luminosity function is the safest way to identify the location of the
bump, since it makes use of stars contained in several magnitude bins
(see also Ferraro et al. 1999, F99 hereafter)."*

### Dolphin 2012:

*"The central field shows measurable star formation until \~2 Gyr ago,
while the outer field shows only about half the number of young (\<8
Gyr) stars. Sagittarius is also the only system for which significant
chemical enrichment is measured. The inner field shows a metallicity of
\[M/H\] = -1.1 ± 0.4 dex at ages older than 8 Gyr, which increased to
\[M/H\] = 0.0 ± 0.2 for the youngest large population of stars (2--4 Gyr
old). The history seen in the outer field is consistent, but the
uncertainties are larger because of the smaller number of stars. No
literature data currently exists using these WFPC2 images; however a few
ground-based studies have been carried out (Layden & Sarajedini 1997;
Marconi et al. 1998; Bellazzini, Ferraro & Buonanno 1999a). Marconi et
al. (1998) and Bellazzini et al. (1999b) found very large metallicity
dispersions, consistent with the significant metallicity evolution
measured in this work. The star formation history is agreed to be
extended, with a peak age agreed to fall between 8 and 11 Gyr; this
compares favourably with the mean ages measured here (8.6 Gyr in the
inner field and 9.8 Gyr in the outer field)."*

NOTE: probably first proper estimation of the SFH of Sgr (not counting
the qualitative studies of Layden and Sarajedini 2000.

### Bellazzini et al. 2003:

We demonstrate that there is a clear statistical correlation between the
(X,Y,Z,Vr) phase-space distribution of the outer halo Galactic globular
clusters (having 10 kpc\<=RGC\<=40 kpc) and the orbital path of the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph), as derived by Ibata &
Lewis. At least four of the sample of 35 globular clusters in this
distance range were formerly members of the Sagittarius galaxy (at the
95% confidence level) and are now distributed along the Sagittarius
Stream, a giant tidal structure that surrounds the Milky Way. This is
the first instance that a statistically significant structure associated
with the Sgr dSph has been detected in the globular cluster population
of the Galactic halo. Together with the four well-known globular
clusters that are located near the center of this tidally disrupting
dwarf galaxy, these clusters constitute \>\~20% of the population of
outer halo (RGC>=10 kpc) clusters. **The Sgr dSph was therefore not only
an important contributor to the halo field-star population, but it also
had a significant role in building up the globular cluster system of the
Milky Way.**

### Bonifacio et al. 2003:

We report our recent results on the abundance ratios in our nearest
neighbour: the Sgr dwarf spheroidal. Based on high resolution spectra
obtained with UVES at the the Kueyen-VLT 8.2m telescope we measured
abundance ratios for 12 giants in Sgr. The dominant population in our
sample is of almost solar metallicity and characterized by an
underabundance of alpha -process elements with respect to iron. The lack
of alpha -element enhancement persists also for the most metal poor star
of the sample (\[Fe/H\]=-0.8), suggesting a star formation which has
been slow or bursting. The spectroscopic metallicity allows to resolve
the age-metallicity degeneracy and we derive from the colour-magnitude
diagram of the galaxy a very young age, of the order of 1 Gyr, or
younger. The high metallicity and young age seem to point to a scenario
in which star bursts are triggered by the passing of Sgr through the
Galactic disc.

*"The sample of C Bulge stars of Azzopardi et al 1991 cannot belong to
Sgr since their radial velocities do not support membership. They could
however be stars formed in the starburst triggered in the Galactic disc,
at the location where it was disturbed by the passage of Sgr (Ng 1997,
1998)."*

**NOTE: yet another mention to a population born \<1Gyr ago (see also
Layden and Sarajedini 2000). But see Hasselquist+21, where they say that
the last star was born \>\~2Gyr ago.**

### Mackey & Gilmore 2003:

We present radial surface brightness profiles for all five globular
clusters in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy, and for the four present
members of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. These profiles are
derived from archival Hubble Space Telescope observations, and have been
calculated using the same techniques with which we measured profiles in
our previous studies of Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC and SMC)
clusters, apart from some small modifications. From the surface
brightness profiles, we have determined structural parameters for each
cluster, including core radii and luminosity and mass estimates. We also
provide a brief summary of literature measurements of other parameters
for these clusters, including their ages, metallicities and distances.

Our core radius measurements are mostly in good agreement with those
from previous lower resolution studies, although for several clusters
our new values are significantly different. The profile for Fornax
cluster 5 does not appear to be well fitted by a King-type model and we
suggest that it is a post-core-collapse candidate. We examine the
distribution of cluster core radii in each of the two dwarf galaxy
systems and compare these with the distribution of core radii for old
LMC clusters. The three distributions match within the limits of
measurement errors and the small-sample sizes. We discuss the
implications of this in the context of the radius-age trend we have
previously highlighted for the Magellanic Cloud clusters.

### Bellazzini et al. 2003:

We use infrared Color Magnitude Diagrams from the 2-Micron All-Sky
Survey (2MASS) to search for stars belonging to the tidal stream of the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) around selected Galactic
globular clusters. Statistically significant detections are presented
for the cases of **Pal 12 and NGC 4147, strongly supporting the idea
that these clusters are associated with the Sgr** Stream and that they
were previous members of the Sgr dSph galaxy.

### Newberg et al. 2003:

A new overdensity of A-colored stars in distant parts of the Milky
Way\'s stellar halo, at a dereddened Sloan Digital Sky Survey magnitude
of g0=20.3, is presented. Identification of associated variable RR Lyrae
candidates supports the claim that these are blue horizontal branch
stars. The inferred distance of these stars from the Galactic center is
90 kpc, assuming that the absolute magnitude of these stars is Mg0=0.7
and that the Sun is 8.5 kpc from the Galactic center. **The new tidal
debris is within 10 kpc of the same plane as other confirmed tidal
debris from the disruption of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and could be
associated with the trailing tidal arm**. Distances to the Sagittarius
stream estimated from M stars are about 13% smaller than our inferred
distances. **The tidal debris has a width of at least 10° and is traced
for more than 20° across the sky. The globular cluster NGC 2419 is
located within the detected tidal debris and may also have once been
associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.**

### Monaco et al. 2003:

We report on the discovery of a blue horizontal-branch (BHB) population
belonging to the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The sequence is
clearly identified in the (V, V-I) color-magnitude diagram obtained for
about 500,000 stars in the region of the globular cluster M54. The BHB
morphology is similar to the analogous sequence in M54, but it is
unambiguously associated with Sgr since (1) it is detected well outside
the main body of the cluster, up to more than five tidal radii from the
cluster center and (2) the BHB stars follow the radial distribution of
the other stellar populations of Sgr. **This finding finally
demonstrates that the Sgr galaxy hosts a significant (of the order of
\~10%) old and metal-poor stellar population (\[Fe/H\]\<\~-1.3 age
\>\~10 Gyr), similar to that of its oldest clusters (M54, Ter 8).** We
also show that the Sgr BHB sequence found here is the counterpart of the
analogous feature observed by Newberg et al. in the Sgr stream, in a
field more than 80° away from the center of the galaxy.

### Majewski et al. 2003:

**We present the first all-sky view of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf
galaxy mapped by M-giant star tracers detected in the complete Two
Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS).** Near-infrared photometry of Sgr\'s
prominent M-giant population permits an unprecedentedly clear view of
the center of Sgr. The main body is fitted with a King profile of
limiting **major-axis radius 30°-substantially larger than previously
found or assumed-beyond which is a prominent break in the density
profile from stars in the Sgr tidal tails;** thus the Sgr radial profile
resembles that of Galactic dwarf speroidal (dSph) satellites. Adopting
traditional methods for analyzing dSph light profiles, we determine the
brightness of the main body of Sgr to be MV=-13.27 (the brightest of the
known Galactic dSph galaxies) and the total Sgr mass-to-light ratio to
be 25 in solar units. However, we regard the latter result with
suspicion and argue that much of the observed structure beyond the
King-fit core radius (224\') may be outside the actual Sgr tidal radius
as the former dwarf spiral/irregular satellite undergoes catastrophic
disruption during its last orbits. **The M-giant distribution of Sgr
exhibits a central density cusp at the same location as, but not due to,
the old stars constituting the globular cluster M54.** A striking
trailing tidal tail is found to extend from the Sgr center and arc
across the south Galactic hemisphere with approximately constant density
and mean distance varying from \~20 to 40 kpc. A prominent leading
debris arm extends from the Sgr center northward of the Galactic plane
to an apogalacticon \~45 kpc from the Sun and then turns toward the
north Galactic cap (NGC), from where it descends back toward the
Galactic plane, becomes foreshortened, and, at brighter magnitudes,
covers the NGC. The leading and trailing Sgr tails lie along a
well-defined orbital plane about the Galactic center. The Sun lies
within a kiloparsec of that plane and near the path of leading Sgr
debris; thus, it is possible that former Sgr stars are near or in the
solar neighborhood. We discuss the implications of this new view of the
Sgr galaxy and its entrails for the character of the Sgr orbit, mass,
mass-loss rate, and contribution of stars to the Milky Way halo. **The
minimal precession displayed by the Sgr tidal debris along its inclined
orbit supports the notion of a nearly spherical Galactic potential.**
**The number of M giants in the Sgr tails is at least 15% that contained
within the King limiting radius of the main Sgr body.** The fact that M
giants, presumably formed within the past few gigayears in the Sgr
nucleus, are nevertheless so widespread along the Sgr tidal arms not
only places limits on the dynamical age of these arms but also poses a
timing problem that bears on the recent binding energy of the Sgr core
and that is most naturally explained by recent and catastrophic mass
loss. Sgr appears to contribute more than 75% of the high-latitude, halo
M giants, despite substantial reservoirs of M giants in the Magellanic
Clouds. No evidence of extended M-giant tidal debris from the Magellanic
Clouds is found. Generally good correspondence is found between the
M-giant, all-sky map of the Sgr system and all previously published
detections of potential Sgr debris, **with the exception of Sgr carbon
stars, which must be subluminous compared with counterparts in other
Galactic satellites in order to resolve the discrepancy.**

*"The relatively steady Sgr tidal tail density suggests a more or less
constant mass-loss rate for the timescale represented by this portion of
the tail."*

*"Figure 13 shows the more significant of these apparent overdensities
as a '' hump '' in the tidal tail distribution for 25 \< Lambda \< 50
\[..\] An apparent widening in the tail at these longitudes is also
suggested by Figure 12 \[..\] If the '' hump '' in Figure 13 is related
to a perigalacticon release event, then a symmetrically placed feature
might be expected in the leading tail; unfortunately, this feature, if
it exists, would lie close to the Galactic plane, where our data become
more confused, although a larger density of stars at -50 \< Lambda \<
-30 is not inconsistent with the data (see Fig. 12)."*

***"If, as is suggested by the Sgr disruption model of Ibata et al.
(2001b), as well as the various pieces of evidence within the M-giant
distribution discussed in Sect.6.4, the leading tidal arm penetrates
back into the south Galactic hemisphere and crosses the trailing arm, we
would expect an increased density of stars at about the longitudes where
the excess density is observed. The presence of overlapping leading-arm
debris could also lead to the observed widening of the apparent trailing
arm at this point either through foreshortening or precessional
displacement of the leading-arm material compared with the true
trailing-arm stars. Radial velocities of stars in the hump should reveal
a clear signal of this overlap. Early evidence from our M-giant radial
velocity work suggest this may be the case (see also the discussion of
overlapping Sgr tails in this part of the sky by Johnston et al.
1999b)."***

**NOTE: on the hump... V21 model predicts the crossing of the L1p2w
material and the Trailing arm at the position where Majewski+03 observes
this "hump". Their second hypothesis seems more plausible.**

*"The apparently decreasing length of both leading and trailing M-giant
tidal tails as we map them with progressively cooler giant star tracers
(Fig. 14) suggests a mean stellar age/metallicity variation along the
tidal tails."*

"As discussed above, because M giants trace only recently formed tidal
debris, they permit only estimates of a lower limit to the net stellar
mass lost by Sgr and the fractional contribution of Sgr debris to the
Milky Way halo. Moreover, in this discussion we have ignored the issue
of whether a sizeable fraction of the stars within the Sgr King profile
represent stars that have become unbound in the most recent
perigalacticon passage along the lines of the scenario envisaged in x
4.3.3. Thus, the mass-loss limit estimated above pertains primarily to
stars detached prior to the recent perigalacticon."

coordinates.**

### Tautvaišienė et al. 2003:

Chemical abundances in three giants in **Terzan 7**, a globular cluster
associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, have been determined using
high-resolution spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph on the ESO
8.2 m Kueyen telescope. We find the overall metallicity of the stars to
be **\[Fe/H\]=-0.61+/-0.07**, which is slightly higher than that
previously evaluated from photometry and used for the age determination
of this cluster. This metallicity yields an age of about **6 Gyr**,
which is slightly lower than derived from previous estimates. The
relative abundance ratios of various chemical elements to iron lie
between those of its host galaxy\'s metal-poor and metal-rich stars and
reveal an intriguing similarity to the pattern seen in the Large
Magellanic Cloud.

### Martinez-Delgado et al. 2004:

The main aim of this paper is to report two new detections of tidal
debris in the northern stream of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy located at
45° and 55° from the center of the galaxy. Our observational approach is
based on deep color-magnitude diagrams that provide accurate distances,
surface brightness, and the properties of stellar population of the
studied region of this tidal stream. The derived distances for these
tidal debris wraps are 45+/-5 and 62+/-6 kpc, respectively. These
detections are also strong observational evidence that the tidal stream
discovered by the Sloan Digitized Sky Survey is tidally stripped
material from the Sagittarius dwarf and support the idea that the tidal
stream completely enwraps the Milky Way in an almost polar orbit. We
also confirm these detections by running numerical simulations of the
Sagittarius dwarf plus the Milky Way. This model reproduces the present
position and velocity of the Sagittarius main body and presents a long
tidal stream formed by tidal interaction with the Milky Way potential.
The tidal streams of the model traces the last orbit of Sagittarius and
confirms our observational detections. This model is also in good
agreement with the available observations of the Sagittarius tidal
stream. The comparison of our model with the positions and distances of
two nonidentified halo overdensities discovered by the Sloan Digitized
Sky Survey and the QUEST survey shows that they are actually associated
with the trailing arm of the Sagittarius tidal stream. In addition, we
identify the proper-motion group discovered by Arnold & Gilmore as a
piece of the Sagittarius northern stream. We also present a method for
estimating the shape of the Milky Way halo potential using numerical
simulations. **From our simulations we obtain an oblateness of the Milky
Way dark halo potential of 0.85**, using the current database of
distances and radial velocities of the Sagittarius tidal stream. **The
color-magnitude diagram of the apocenter of Sagittarius shows that this
region of the stream shares the complex star formation history observed
in the main body of the galaxy. We present the first evidence for a
gradient in the stellar population along the stream, possibly correlated
with its different pericenter passages.**

*"There is evidence of the presence of stellar populations of different
ages in the Sgr tidal stream too. The detection of a significant RR
Lyrae population associated with the northern stream (Ivezic´ et al.
2000; Vivas et al. 2001) is a strong indication of the presence of an
old, metal-poor population. The identification of bright carbon stars
(Ibata et al. 2001b) and a*

*bright M-giant population (Majewski et al. 2003) along the Sgr stream
points to the presence of a metal-rich intermediate age population along
the stream too. This is consistent with the CMD morphology of the SDSS
stream by Newberg et al. (2002), which shows a conspicuous red clump of
helium burning stars."*

NOTES: they don't really measure any population gradient. Instead, they
justify the two \[Fe/H\] metallicities, \~-1.5dex, in the leading
(Dohm-Palmer et al. (2001)) and trailing (Martı´nez-Delgado et al.
(2002b)) arm with the fact that their model predicts material striped
\~3Gyr ago at those positions. However, even if there was no new star
formation before starting the stripping process, there would still be a
metallicity gradient due to the fact that the more metal rich stars
would have much higher bonding energies.

**NOTES: their model does not resemble the modern models in that their
distribution around the MW is not consistent (in V21, the leading arm
wraps faster and the trailing has a long tail reaching Rgc\~100kpc).
Also, they have stars stripped more than 5Gyr ago.**

### Bonifacio et al. 2004:

We report on abundances of O, Mg, Si, Ca and Fe for 10 giants in the Sgr
dwarf spheroidal derived from high resolution spectra obtained with UVES
at the 8.2 m Kueyen-VLT telescope. The iron abundance spans the range
-0.8 ⪉ \[Fe/H\] ⪉ 0.0 and the dominant population is relatively
metal-rich with \[Fe/H\]∼ -0.25. The α/Fe ratios are slightly subsolar,
even at the lowest observed metallicities suggesting a slow or bursting
star formation rate. From our sample of 12 giants (including the two
observed by \\citealt{B00}) we conclude that a substantial metal rich
population exists in Sgr, which dominates the sample. The spectroscopic
metallicities allow one to break the age-metallicity degeneracy in the
interpretation of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). **Comparison of
isochrones of appropriate metallicity with the observed CMD suggests an
age of 1 Gyr or younger**, for the dominant Sgr population sampled by
us. We argue that the observations support a **star formation that is
triggered by the passage of Sgr through the Galactic disc, both in Sgr
and in the disc.** This scenario has also the virtue of explaining the
mysterious \`\`bulge C stars\'\' as disc stars formed in this event. The
interaction of Sgr with the Milky Way is likely to have played a major
role in its evolution.

### Cohen 2004:

We present a detailed abundance analysis for 21 elements based on
high-dispersion, high spectral resolution Keck spectra for four members
of the outer halo \`\`young\'\' Galactic globular cluster Palomar 12.
All four stars show identical abundance distributions with no credible
indication of any star-to-star scatter. However, the abundance ratios of
the Pal 12 stars are very peculiar. There is no detected enhancement of
the α-elements the mean of \[Si/Fe\], \[Ca/Fe\], and \[Ti/Fe\] is
-0.07+/-0.05 dex, O/Fe is also solar, while Na is very deficient. The
distribution among the heavy elements shows anomalies as well. These are
inconsistent with those of almost all Galactic globular clusters or of
field stars in the Galaxy. The peculiarities shown by the Pal 12 stars
are, however, in good general agreement with the trends established by
Smecker-Hane & McWilliam and by Bonifacio et al. for stars in the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy evaluated at the \[Fe/H\] of
Pal 12. **This reinforces earlier suggestions that Pal 12 originally was
a cluster in the Sgr dSph galaxy that during the process of accretion of
this galaxy by our own was tidally stripped from the Sgr galaxy to
become part of the extended Sgr stream.**

### Putman et al. 2004:

A possible gaseous component to the stream of debris from the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy is presented. We identify (4-10)×106 Msolar of
neutral hydrogen along the orbit of the Sgr dwarf in the direction of
the Galactic anticenter (at 36 kpc, the distance to the stellar debris
in this region). This is 1%-2% of the estimated total mass of the Sgr
dwarf. Both the stellar and gaseous components have negative velocities,
but the gaseous component extends to higher negative velocities. **If
associated, this gaseous stream was most likely stripped from the main
body of the dwarf 0.2-0.3 Gyr ago during its current orbit after a
passage through a diffuse edge of the Galactic disk** with a density
greater than 10-4 cm-3. **This gas represents the dwarf\'s last source
of star formation fuel and explains how the galaxy was forming stars
0.5-2 Gyr ago.**

NOTE: the location (last bit of the trailing arm in the south (galactic)
before going behind the disc) and radial velocity of the HI gas seems
consistent with the stellar stream.

### Majewski et al. 2004:

We have obtained moderate resolution (\~6 km s-1) spectroscopy of
several hundred M giant candidates selected from Two Micron All Sky
Survey photometry. Radial velocities are presented for stars mainly in
the southern Galactic hemisphere, and the primary targets have Galactic
positions consistent with association to the tidal tail system of the
Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy. M giant stars selected from the apparent
trailing debris arm of Sgr have velocities showing a clear trend with
orbital longitude, as expected from models of the orbit and destruction
of Sgr. **A minimum 8 kpc width of the trailing stream about the Sgr
orbital midplane is implied by verified radial velocity members. The
coldness of this stream (σv\~10 km s-1) provides upper limits on the
combined contributions of stream heating by a lumpy Galactic halo and
the intrinsic dispersion of released stars, which is a function of the
Sgr core mass.** We find that the Sgr trailing arm is consistent with a
Galactic halo that contains one dominant, LMC-like lump; however, some
lumpier halos are not ruled out. An upper limit to the total
mass-to-light ratio of the Sgr core is 21 in solar units. **Evidence for
other velocity structures is found among the more distant (>13 kpc) M
giants. A second structure that roughly mimics expectations for wrapped,
leading Sgr arm debris crosses the trailing arm in the southern
hemisphere**; however, this may also be an unrelated tidal feature.
Among the bright, nearby (\<13 kpc) M giants toward the south Galactic
pole are a number with large velocities that identify them as halo
stars; these too may trace halo substructure, perhaps part of the Sgr
leading arm near the Sun. The positions and velocities of southern
hemisphere M giants are compared with those of southern hemisphere
globular clusters potentially stripped from the Sgr system. **Support
for association of the globular clusters Pal 2 and Pal 12 with Sgr
debris is found, based on positional and radial velocity matches.** Our
discussion includes description of a masked-filtered cross-correlation
methodology that achieves better than 1/20 of a resolution element
velocities in moderate-resolution spectra. The improved velocity
resolution achieved allows tighter constraints to be placed on the
coldness of the Sgr stream than previously established.

### Monaco et al. 2004:

We derived the distance to the central region of the Sagittarius (Sgr)
dwarf spheroidal galaxy from the red giant branch tip. The obtained
distance modulus is (m-M)0= 17.10 +/- 0.15, corresponding to a
**heliocentric distance D= 26.30 +/- 1.8Kpc**. This estimate is in good
agreement with the distance obtained from RR Lyrae (RR Ly) stars of the
globular cluster M 54, located in the core of the Sgr galaxy, once the
most accurate estimate of the cluster metallicity and the most recent
calibration of the MV(RRLy) versus \[Fe/H\] relation are adopted.

### Vivas et al. 2005

Sixteen RR Lyrae variables from the QUEST survey that lie in the leading
arm of the tidal stream from the Sagittarius dSph galaxy have been
observed spectroscopically to measure their radial velocities and metal
abundances. The systemic velocities of 14 stars, which were determined
by fitting a standard velocity curve to the individual measurements,
have a sharply peaked distribution with a **mean of 33 km s-1 and a
standard deviation of only 25 km s-1. The \[Fe/H\] distribution of these
stars has a mean of -1.76 and a standard deviation of 0.22**. These
measurements are in good agreement with previous ones from smaller
samples of stars. The mean metallicity is consistent with the
age-metallicity relation that is observed in the main body of the Sgr
dSph galaxy. The radial velocities and the distances from the Sun of
these stars are compared with recent numerical simulations of the Sgr
streams that assume different shapes for the dark matter halo. Models
that assume a oblate halo do not fit the data as well as ones that
assume a spherical or a prolate distribution. **However, none of the
fits are completely satisfactory. Every model fails to reproduce the
long extent of the stream in right ascension (36°, tip of the trailing
arm close to the disc) that is seen in the region covered by the QUEST
survey.** Further modeling is required to see if this and the other
mismatches between theory and observation can be removed by judicial
choices for the model parameters or instead rule out a class of models.

### Dinescu et al. 2005:

We have determined the absolute proper motion of the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) from the Southern Proper Motion Catalog 3, by
selecting red giant candidates from the Two Micron All Sky Survey. We
obtain **μlcosb=-2.35+/-0.20 and μb=2.07+/-0.20 mas yr-1**. Using the
same procedure, we also determine the absolute proper motion of the
bulge in the region of the sky that overlaps with Sgr. For the bulge, we
obtain μlcosb=-5.86+/-0.14 and μb=-0.59+/-0.14 mas yr-1, at l=7.6d and
b=-21.2d. The absolute proper motions are on the International Celestial
Reference System via Hipparcos Catalog stars.

### Monaco et al. 2005:

We present an analysis of the density profile in the central region of
the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. A strong density enhancement of
Sgr stars is observed. The position of the peak of the detected cusp is
indistinguishable from the centre of M54. The photometric properties of
the cusp are fully compatible with those observed in the nuclei of dwarf
elliptical galaxies, indicating that the **Sgr dSph would appear as a
nucleated galaxy independently of the presence of M54 at its centre.**

### Monaco et al. 2005:

We present iron and α element (Mg, Ca, Ti) abundances for a sample of 15
Red Giant Branch stars belonging to the main body of the Sagittarius
dwarf Spheroidal galaxy. Abundances have been obtained from spectra
collected using the high resolution spectrograph FLAMES-UVES mounted at
the VLT**. Stars of our sample have a mean metallicity of \[
Fe/H\]=-0.41±0.20 with a metal-poor tail extending to \[ Fe/H\]=-1.52.
The α element abundance ratios are slightly subsolar for metallicities
higher than \[Fe/H\]⪆-1, suggesting a slow star formation rate.** The \[
α/Fe\] of stars having \[Fe/H\]\<-1 are compatible to what observed in
Milky Way stars of comparable metallicity.

### Bellazzini et al. 2006:

We present a statistically decontaminated Color Magnitude Diagram of a
1°× 1° field in the core of the Sagittarius dSph galaxy. Coupling this
CMD with the most recent metallicity distributions obtained from high
resolution spectroscopy we derive robust constraints on the mean age of
the stellar population that dominates the galaxy (Pop A). Using three
different sets of theoretical isochrones in the metallicity range -0.4≤
\[M/H\]≤ -0.7 and taking into consideration distance moduli in the range
16.90≤ (m-M)\_0≤ 17.20 **we find that the mean age of Pop A is larger
than 5 Gyr, and the best-fit value is age = 8.0± 1.5 Gyr. Since Pop A
provides the vast majority of the M giants that traces the tidal stream
of Sgr dSph all over the sky, our estimate resolves the so called \"M
giant conundrum\" (Majewski et al. 2003, ApJ, 599, 1082).** The time
needed by the M giants that currently populates the stream to diffuse
within the main body of Sgr and to reach the extremes of the tidal tails
once torn apart from the parent galaxy (≃3{-}4 Gyr) can be easily
accommodated into the time lapsed since their birth (≃5.5{-}9.5 Gyr).

### Belokurov et al. 2006:

We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 (DR5) u, g, r, i,
z photometry to study Milky Way halo substructure in the area around the
north Galactic cap. A simple color cut (g-r\<0.4) reveals the tidal
stream of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, as well as a number
of other stellar structures in the field. Two branches (A and B) of the
Sagittarius stream are clearly visible in an RGB composite image created
from three magnitude slices, and there is also evidence for a still more
distant wrap behind the A branch. A comparison of these data with
numerical models suggests that the shape of the Galactic dark halo is
close to spherical.

*"field A7 \[..\] there are two subgiant branches visible in the CMD,
and two distinct peaks in the luminosity functions in the second panel.
**These correspond to two distinct structures at different distances,
possibly different wraps of the Sgr stream.** Although they could
correspond to different populations at the same distance, this seems
unlikely as **the magnitude difference between the two subgiant branches
changes on moving along the stream. \[..\] The two distinct structures
in the A fields are separated by distances of up to ≈15 kpc. Note that
there is no evidence for any part of the Sgr stream passing close to the
solar neighborhood, as has sometimes been conjectured (Freese et al.
2004). \[..\] f Figure 3 of Helmi (2004), where there are two close
branches representing material stripped between 3 and 6.5 Gyr ago, and
less than 3 Gyr ago. Branches A and***

***B are therefore probably tidal debris, torn off at different times.
The older material, stripped off more than 6.5 Gyr ago, lies well behind
the two close branches in Helmi's simulations. This earlier wrap of the
orbit may correspond to the distant structure seen behind the A
branch."***

NOTE: if these are indeed different wraps of the stream, it has to be
either the L1p1w material (which would invalidate the Penarrubia10
hypothesis on the origin of the bifurcation) or the T1p2w material,
which overlaps with the L2p1w with a similar distance at field A7 (based
on V21 model). In fact, if it was L1p1w, there shouldn't be any
appreciable difference in distance. It would be VERY valuable to know
the direction of change in distance between these two subgiant branches
since one would expect from V21 that the difference between L2p1w and
T1p2w to increase with Lambda (decreasing RA) as L2p1w decreases in
distance and T1p2w increases.

NOTE: we see in Fig.4 right panel that the distance between the two SGB
increases with Lambda, as expected from T1p2w-L2p1w overlap. Based on
their discussion, this seems to be also the conclusion reached by the
authors, but based on Helmi+04, a somewhat far from perfect model of the
stream.

### Clewley & Jarvis 2006:

We present two-degree field spectroscopic observations of a sample of 96
A-type stars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3
(SDSS DR3). Our aim is to identify blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars in
order to measure the kinematic properties of the tidal tails of the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We confine our attention to the 44
classifiable stars with spectra of signal-to-noise ratio \>15 Å-1.
Classification produces a sample of 29 BHB stars at distances of 5-47
kpc from the Sun. We split our sample into three bins based on their
distance. We find 10 of the 12 stars at 14-25 kpc appear to have
coherent, smoothly varying radial velocities which are plausibly
associated with old debris in the Sagittarius tidal stream. Further
observations along the orbit and at greater distances are required to
trace the full extent of this structure on the sky. Three of our BHB
stars in the direction of the globular cluster Palomar (Pal) 5 appear to
be in an overdensity but are in the foreground of Pal 5. More
observations are required around this overdensity to establish any
relation to Pal 5 and/or the Sgr stream. We emphasize observations of
BHB stars have unlimited potential for providing accurate velocity and
distance information in old distant halo streams and globular clusters
alike. The next-generation multi-object spectrographs provide an
excellent opportunity to accurately trace the full extent of such
structures.

### Zijlstra et al. 2006:

The identification of two new planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Sagittarius
dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) is presented. This brings the total number
to four. Both new PNe were previously classified as Galactic objects.
The first, StWr 2-21, belongs to the main body of Sgr, from its velocity
and location. The second, the halo PN BoBn1, has a location, distance
and velocity in agreement with the leading tidal tail of Sgr. **We
estimate that 10 per cent of the Galactic halo consists of Sgr debris.**
The specific frequency of PNe indicates a total luminosity of Sgr,
including its tidal tails, of MV = -14.1. StWr 2-21 shows a high
abundance of \[O/H\]= -0.23, which **confirms the high-metallicity
population in Sgr** uncovered by Bonifacio et al. The steep
metallicity-age gradient in Sgr is due to interstellar medium (ISM)
removal during the Galactic plane passages, ISM reformation due to
stellar mass-loss, and possibly accretion of metal-enriched gas from our
Galaxy. **The ISM re-formation rate of Sgr, from stellar mass-loss, is 5
× 10\^-4Msolaryr-1, amounting to \~10\^6Msolar per orbital period.**

Hubble Space Telescope images of three of the PNe reveal well-developed
bipolar morphologies, and provide clear detections of the central stars.
All three stars with deep spectra show WR lines, suggesting that the
progenitor mass and metallicity determines whether a PN central star
develops a WR spectrum. One Sgr PN belongs to the class of IR-\[WC\]
stars. Expansion velocities are determined for three nebulae. Comparison
with hydrodynamical models indicates an initial density profile of ρ \~
r-3. This is evidence for increasing mass-loss rates on the asymptotic
giant branch. Peak mass-loss rates are indicated of \~10-4Msolaryr-1.

**The IR-\[WC\] PN, He2-436, provides the sole direct detection of dust
in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, to date.**

### Bellazzini et al. 2006

We present a quantitative comparison between the Horizontal Branch
morphology in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr)
and in a wide field sampling a portion of its tidal stream (Sgr Stream),
located tens of kpc away from the center of the parent galaxy. We find
that the Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB) stars in that part of the Stream
are five times more abundant than in the Sgr core, relative to Red Clump
stars. The difference in the ratio of BHB to RC stars between the two
fields is significant at the ⪆4.8σ level. **This indicates that the old
and metal-poor population of Sgr was preferentially stripped from the
galaxy in past peri-Galactic passages with respect to the
intermediate-age metal rich population that presently dominates the
bound core of Sgr**, probably due to a strong radial gradient that was
settled within the galaxy before its disruption. The technique adopted
in the present study allows to trace population gradients along the
whole extension of the Stream.

### Ramsay & Wu 2006:

ROSAT observations found no convincing evidence for X-ray sources
located in local dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph). Now with more
sensitive instruments on board Chandra and XMM-Newton we can reach
fainter luminosity levels. We report on an observation of the
Sagittarius (Sgr) dSph made using Chandra and an observation of the
Carina (Car) dSph made using XMM-Newton. Our observations are sensitive
to sources with X-ray luminosities in the 0.1-10 keV band of \~1×1032
erg s-1 and 3×1034 erg s-1 for the Sgr and Car fields respectively. We
have identified a total of 80 sources in the Sgr field and 53 sources in
the Car field. **Although the source numbers are roughly consistent with
the expected number of background AGN**, we found a small fraction of
X-ray sources which were soft and could be located in the host dSph.
Follow-up optical/IR observations may help to identify their optical
counterparts and hence determine their nature.

### Monaco et al. 2007:

Context: The Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy is currently
being disrupted under the strain of the Milky Way. A reliable
reconstruction of Sgr star formation history can only be obtained by
combining core and stream information.

Aims: We present radial velocities for 67 stars belonging to the Sgr
Stream. For 12 stars in the sample we also present iron (Fe) and
α-element (Mg, Ca) abundances.

Methods: Spectra were secured using different high resolution
facilities: UVES\@VLT, HARPS\@3.6 m, and SARG\@TNG. Radial velocities
are obtained through cross correlation with a template spectra.
Concerning chemical analysis, for the various elements, selected line
equivalent widths were measured and abundances computed using the WIDTH
code and ATLAS model atmospheres.

Results: **The velocity dispersion of the trailing tail is found to be σ
= 8.3 ± 0.9 km s-1, i.e., significantly lower than in the core of the
Sgr galaxy and marginally lower than previous estimates in the same
portion of the stream. Stream stars follow the same trend as Sgr main
body stars in the \[ α/Fe\] vs. \[Fe/H\] plane. However, stars are, on
average, more metal poor in the stream than in the main body.** This
effect is slightly stronger in stars belonging to more ancient wraps of
the stream, according to currently accepted models of Sgr disruption.

### Sbordone et al. 2007:

Context: The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy is the nearest neighbor
of the Milky Way. Moving along a short period quasi-polar orbit within
the Halo, it is being destroyed by the tidal interaction with our
Galaxy, losing its stellar content along a huge stellar stream.

Aims: We study the detailed chemical composition of 12 giant stars in
the Sagittarius dwarf Spheroidal main body, together with 5 more in the
associated globular cluster Terzan 7, by means of high resolution
VLT-UVES spectra.

Methods: Abundances are derived for up to 21 elements from O to Nd, by
fitting lines EW or line profiles against ATLAS 9 model atmospheres and
SYNTHE spectral syntheses calculated ad-hoc. Temperatures are derived
from (V-I)0 or (B-V)0 colors and gravities from Fe I - Fe II ionization
equilibrium.

Results: The metallicity of the observed stars is between \[Fe/H\] =
-0.9 and 0. We detected a highly peculiar \"chemical signature\", with
undersolar α elements, Na, Al, Sc, V, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn, among others,
and overabundant La, Ce, and Nd. Many of these abundance ratios (in
particular light-odd elements and iron peak ones) are strongly at odds
with what is observed within the Milky Way, so they may be a very useful
tool for recognizing populations originating within the Sagittarius
dwarf. This can be clearly seen in the case of the globular Palomar 12,
which is believed to have been stripped from Sagittarius: the cluster
shows precisely the same chemical \"oddities\", thus finally confirming
its extragalactic origin.

Carraro et al. 2007:

Context: Recently, Carraro (2005) drew attention to the remarkable star
cluster **Whiting 1** by showing that it lies about 40 kpc from the Sun
and is therefore unquestionably a member of the Galactic halo (b=-60.6
deg). Its Color Magnitude Diagram (CMD) indicated that **Whiting 1 is
very young (\~5 Gyr)** for a globular cluster. It is very likely that
Whiting 1 originated in a dwarf galaxy that has since been disrupted by
the Milky Way.

Aims: The main goals of this investigation were to constrain better the
age, metallicity, and distance of Whiting 1 and to assess whether it
belongs to a stellar stream from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy
(Sgr dSph).

Methods: Deep CCD photometry in the BVI pass-bands obtained with the VLT
is used to improve the quality of the CMD and to determine the
cluster\'s luminosity function and surface density profile.
High-resolution spectrograms obtained with Magellan are used to measure
the cluster\'s radial velocity and to place limits on its possible
metallicity. The measurements of distance and radial velocity are used
to test the cluster\'s membership in the stellar streams from the Sgr
dSph.

Results: **From our CMD of Whiting 1, we derive new estimates for the
cluster\'s age (6.5+1.0-0.5 Gyr), metallicity (Z=0.004±0.001, \[Fe/H\] =
-0.65), and distance (29.4+1.8-2.0 kpc).** From echelle spectrograms of
three stars, we obtain -130.6±1.8 km s-1 for the cluster\'s radial
velocity and show from measurements of two infra-red CaII lines that the
\[Fe/H\] of the cluster probably lies in the range -1.1 to -0.4. Both
the luminosity function and the surface density profile **suggest that
the cluster has undergone tidal stripping by the Milky Way**. We
demonstrate that the position of Whiting 1 on the sky, its distance from
the Sun, and its radial velocity are identical to within the errors of
both the theoretical predictions of the trailing stream of stars from
the Sgr dSph galaxy and the previous observations of the M giant stars
that delineate the streams.

Conclusions: **With the addition of Whiting 1, there is now strong
evidence that 6 globular clusters formed within the Sgr dSph. Whiting 1
is particularly interesting because it is the youngest and among the
most metal rich.** The relatively young age of Whiting 1 demonstrates
that **this dwarf galaxy was able to form star clusters for a period of
at least 6 Gyr, and the age and metallicity of Whiting 1 are consistent
with the age-metallicity relationship in the main body of the Sgr
dSph.** The presence now of Whiting 1 in the Galactic halo provides
additional support for the view that the young halo clusters originated
in dwarf galaxies that have been accreted by the Milky Way.

### Siegel et al. 2007:

As part of the ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters, we present new
Hubble Space Telescope photometry of the massive globular cluster M54
(NGC 6715) and the superposed core of the tidally disrupted Sagittarius
(Sgr) dSph galaxy. Our deep (F606W \~ 26.5), high-precision photometry
yields an unprecedentedly detailed color-magnitude diagram showing the
extended blue horizontal branch and multiple main sequences of the
M54+Sgr system. The distance and reddening to M54 are revised using both
isochrone and main-sequence fitting to (m-M)0=17.27 and E(B-V)=0.15.
Preliminary assessment finds the M54+Sgr field to be dominated by the
old metal-poor populations of Sgr and the globular cluster. Multiple
turnoffs indicate the presence of at least two intermediate-aged star
formation epochs with 4 and 6 Gyr ages and \[Fe/H\]=-0.4 to -0.6. **We
also clearly show, for the first time, a prominent, \~2.3 Gyr old Sgr
population of near-solar abundance. A trace population of even younger
(\~0.1-0.8 Gyr old), more metal-rich (\[Fe/H\]\~0.6) stars is also
indicated. The Sgr age-metallicity relation is consistent with a
closed-box model and multiple (4-5) star formation bursts** over the
entire life of the satellite, including the time since Sgr began
disrupting.

### Newberg et al. 2007:

We investigate the relationship between several previously identified
Galactic halo stellar structures in the direction of Virgo using imaging
and spectroscopic observations of F turnoff stars and blue
horizontal-branch stars from SDSS and SEGUE. We show that the
Sagittarius dwarf leading tidal tail does not pass through the solar
neighborhood; it misses the Sun by more than 15 kpc, passing through the
Galactic plane outside the solar circle. Nor is it spatially coincident
with the large stellar overdensity S297+63-20.5 in the Virgo
constellation. S297+63-20.5 has a distinct turnoff color and kinematics.
Faint (g0\~20.3) turnoff stars in S297+63-20.5 have line-of-sight,
Galactic standard of rest velocities Vgsr=130+/-10 km s-1, opposite in
sign to infalling Sgr tail stars. The path of the Sgr leading tidal tail
is also inconsistent with the positions of some of the nearer stars with
which it has been associated and whose velocities have favored models
with prolate Milky Way potentials. We also show that the number
densities of brighter (g0\~19.8) F turnoff stars are not symmetric about
the Galactic center and that this discrepancy is not primarily due to
the S297+63-20.5 moving group. Either the spheroid is asymmetric about
the Galactic center or there are additional substructures that conspire
to be on the same side of the Galaxy as S297+63-20.5. The S297+63-20.5
overdensity in Virgo is likely associated with two other previously
identified Virgo substructures: the Virgo stellar stream (VSS) and the
Virgo overdensity (VOD). However, the velocity difference between the
VSS and S297+63-20.5 and the difference in distance estimates between
the VOD and S297+63-20.5 must be reconciled.

NOTE: Virgo overdensity is NOT Sgr.

### Chou et al. 2007:

We present reliable measurements of the metallicity distribution
function (MDF) at different points along the tidal stream of the
Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy, based on
high-resolution, echelle spectroscopy of candidate M giant members of
the Sgr system. **The Sgr MDF is found to evolve significantly from a
median \[Fe/H\]\~-0.4 in the core to \~-1.1 dex over a Sgr leading arm
length representing \~2.5-3.0 Gyr of dynamical (i.e., tidal stripping)
age.** This is direct evidence that there can be significant chemical
differences between current dSph satellites and the bulk of the stars
they have contributed to the halo. **Our results suggest that Sgr
experienced a significant change in binding energy over the past several
gigayears, which has substantially decreased its tidal boundary across a
radial range over which there must have been a significant metallicity
gradient in the progenitor galaxy.** By accounting for MDF variation
along the debris arms, we approximate the MDF Sgr would have had several
gigayears ago. We also analyze the MDF of a moving group of M giants we
previously discovered toward the north Galactic cap. These objects have
the opposite radial velocities to the infalling Sgr leading arm stars
there, and **we propose that most of them represent Sgr trailing arm
stars overlapping the Sgr leading arm in this part of the sky.** If so,
these trailing arm stars further demonstrate the strong MDF evolution
within the Sgr stream.

*"(1) the trailing arm is dynamically much better understood than the
leading arm (Helmi 2004; Law et al. 2005) (2) the sorting of stars by
dynamical age is much cleaner in the trailing arm than the leading arm"*

NOTES: very little data, not sure the distances match with their
interpretation of the leading/trailing arms, the radial velocities kinda
support it but again, very little data. The MDF of the farthest leading
arm material (south) is not that different from the young leading arm
(north) either. But it is true that the metallicity of these far-away
stars is crucial.

### Keller et al. 2008:

We present a search for RR Lyrae variable stars from archival
observations of the Southern Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt Object survey. The
survey covers 1675 deg2 along the ecliptic to a mean depth of V = 19.5,
i.e., a heliocentric distance of \~50 kpc for RR Lyrae stars. The survey
reveals 2016 RR Lyrae candidates. Follow-up photometric monitoring of a
subset of these candidates shows \~24% contamination by non-RR Lyrae
variables. We derive a map of overdensity of RR Lyrae stars in the halo
that reveals a series of structures coincident with the leading and
trailing arms of debris from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. One of the
regions of overdensity is found on the trailing arm, 200° from the main
body of the Sagittarius dwarf at a distance of \~45 kpc. This distant
detection of the stellar population of the outer trailing arm of
Sagittarius offers a tight constraint on the motion of the dwarf galaxy.
**A distinctly separate region of overdensity is seen toward the Virgo
overdensity.**

*"The Sgr leading arm is potentially seen in the overdensity located at
RA \~ 115deg and distance of 15 kpc (see Fig. 19). This region is a
confluence of the Monoceros Ring and Sagittarius stream both located at
15--20 kpc in this region ( Ibata et al. 2003; Belokurov et al. 2006,
respectively).* ***The Sgr leading arm then passes above our survey area
until it is again intercepted at RA\~220deg , Dist \~ 50 kpc.**"*

*" we see overdensities coincident with the trailing arm from RA \~ 287
to 330 deg , Dist \~ 25 kpc. The trailing arm then passes underneath our
survey area before potentially emerging at **RA \~ 130deg , Dist \~ 45
kpc**."*

NOTE: this detection of the leading arm in the north (RA\~130deg) is at
odds with the more recent determinations of the Sgr RR Lyrae
distribution (e.g. Ramos et al. 2020). Not quite sure what their
detection is. Sidenote: the RR Lyrae in this region should correspond to
the stars stripped at early times (T1p2w in V21).

NOTE: they detect the leading arm veeeery close to the disc, at
RA\~115deg / dist\~15kpc. This is important because the young leading
arm (L2p1w in V21) should end around that point, after that it's all old
material. It's a good anchor to take into account and that Gaia has
problems with.

### Mottini et al. 2008

To compare the globular clusters (GCs) associated with the Sagittarius
Galaxy (Sgr) we report the results obtained from new high-resolution
spectra of red giant stars in Terzan 8 and Arp 2, collected with the
Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) spectrograph at Las Campanas
Observatory. For **Ter 8 we find \[Fe I/H\] = -2.37 ± 0.04 and \[Fe
II/H\] = -2.30 ± 0.07, while for Arp 2 \[Fe I/H\] = -1.77 ± 0.04 and
\[Fe II/H\] = -1.89 ± 0.07.** Other elements, usually of interest, show
the following results. For oxygen, we obtain \[O/Fe\] = 0.71 ± 0.17 for
Ter 8 and \[O/Fe\] = 0.21 ± 0.22 for Arp 2. For the **α-elements (Mg,
Si, Ca, Ti), the mean values are 0.37 ± 0.14 dex for Ter 8 and 0.31 ±
0.11 for Arp 2**. These values are not too different from the Galactic
GCs at a similar \[Fe/H\] value. Regarding Cu, we find quite
underabundant results for both clusters: \[Cu/Fe\] = -0.96 for Ter 8 and
\[Cu/Fe\] = -0.93 for Arp 2. The heavy s-process elements Ba and Nd show
no excesses in Ter 8 and Arp 2. Our only r-process element, Eu, shows an
excess of 0.45 dex in Arp 2, based on the only useful line at 6645 Å.

### Mottini et al. 2008:

Both Sagittarius (Sgr) and Fornax have a complex structure and a system
of globular clusters (GCs) at variance with the classic concept of dwarf
spheroidal galaxies: simple, uniform spherical systems. Sgr and Fornax
are of similar total mass but present great differences in some aspects.
We compare the GCs of these two galaxies using the results from
spectroscopic studies available in the literature. The Sgr GCs present a
wide range in metallicity and they can be divided in two groups: young,
metal-rich clusters with a red horizontal branch (HB) and old,
metal-poor clusters with a blue HB. On the other hand, the Fornax
clusters show similar metallicity and have essentially the same age
(with the possible exception of cluster 4 that seems to be 3 Gyr
younger) but have a wide range of HB types. The most metal-poor cluster
in the Sgr system, Ter 8, has a metallicity comparable with the Fornax
globular results. Oxygen and α-elements abundances of the Fornax
clusters and the metal-poor Sgr globulars are similar and, with the
metal-rich Sgr clusters, they appear to follow the same patterns found
in Galactic GC stars. The behavior of the light and heavy s-process
elements with the iron content shows analogous results for the Sgr
metal-poor clusters and the Fornax clusters. **We can say that the Sgr
GCs are more like those in the Milky Way (MW) with a range in
metallicities while Fornax clusters are more similar to the very outer
MW clusters with second parameter problems.**

NOTE: what are the implications??

### Cole et al. 2008:

We present a maximum likelihood method for determining the spatial
properties of tidal debris and of the Galactic spheroid. With this
method we characterize Sagittarius debris using stars with the colors of
blue F turnoff stars in SDSS stripe 82. The debris is located at (α ,δ
,R) = (31.37°+/- 0.26°,0.0°,29.22 +/- 0.20 kpc) , with a (spatial)
direction given by the unit vector (- 0.991 +/- 0.007 kpc ,0.042 +/-
0.033 kpc ,0.127 +/- 0.046 kpc) , in galactocentric Cartesian
coordinates, and with FWHM = 6.74 +/- 0.06 kpc. This 2.5° wide stripe
contains 0.9% as many F turnoff stars as the current Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy. Over small spatial extent, the debris is modeled as a cylinder
with a density that falls off as a Gaussian with distance from the axis,
while the smooth component of the spheroid is modeled with a Hernquist
profile. We assume that the absolute magnitude of F turnoff stars is
distributed as a Gaussian, which is an improvement over previous methods
which fixed the absolute magnitude at \\overline{M}g0=4.2. The
effectiveness and correctness of the algorithm is demonstrated on a
simulated set of F turnoff stars created to mimic SDSS stripe 82 data,
which shows that we have a much greater accuracy than previous studies.
Our algorithm can be applied to divide the stellar data into two
catalogs: one which fits the stream density profile and one with the
characteristics of the spheroid. **This allows us to effectively
separate tidal debris from the spheroid population**, both facilitating
the study of the tidal stream dynamics and providing a test of whether a
smooth spheroidal population exists.

### Kniazev et al. 2008:

In this work we present the first spectroscopic results obtained with
the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) during its
performance-verification phase. We find that the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) contains a youngest stellar population with
\[O/H\] \~ -0.2 and age t \> 1Gyr, and an oldest population with
\[O/H\]= -2.0. The values are based on spectra of two planetary nebulae
(PNe), using empirical abundance determinations. We calculated
abundances for O, N, Ne, Ar, S, Cl, Fe, C and He. We confirm the high
abundances of PN StWr2-21 with 12 + log(O/H) = 8.57 +/- 0.02 dex. The
other PN studied, BoBn1, is an extraordinary object in that the neon
abundance exceeds that of oxygen. The abundances of S, Ar and Cl in
BoBn1 yield the original stellar metallicity, corresponding to 12 +
log(O/H) = 6.72 +/- 0.16 dex which is 1/110 of the solar value. The
actual \[O/H\] is much higher: third dredge-up enriched the material by
a factor of \~12 in oxygen, \~240 in nitrogen and \~70 in neon. Neon as
well as nitrogen and oxygen content may have been produced in the
intershell of low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Well defined
broad WR lines are present in the spectrum of StWr2-21 and absent in the
spectrum of BoBn1. This puts the fraction of \[WR\]-type central PNe
stars to 67 per cent for dSph galaxies.

### Bellazzini et al. 2008:

We present the results of a thorough study of the nucleus of the Sgr
dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) and of the bright globular cluster
M54 (NGC 6715) that resides within the same nucleus (Sgr,N). We have
obtained accurate radial velocities and metallicity estimates for 1152
candidate red giant branch stars of Sgr and M54 lying within \~9\' from
the center of the galaxy, from Keck/DEIMOS and VLT/FLAMES spectra of the
infrared Ca II triplet. Using both velocity and metallicity information
we selected two samples of 425 and 321 very likely members of M54 and of
Sgr,N, respectively. The two considered systems display significantly
different velocity dispersion profiles. M54 has a steeply decreasing
profile from r = 0\', where σ sime 14.2 km s-1, to r sime 3farcm5 where
it reaches σ sime 5.3 km s-1, then it appears to rise again to σ sime 10
km s-1 at r \~ 7\'. In contrast Sgr,N has a uniformly flat profile at σ
sime 9.6 km s-1 over the whole 0\' \<= r \<= 9\' range. Using data from
the literature we show that the velocity dispersion of Sgr remains
constant at least out to r \~ 100\' and there is no sign of the
transition between the outer flat-luminosity-profile core and the inner
nucleus in the velocity profile. These results, together with a
re-analysis of the surface brightness profile of Sgr,N and a suite of
dedicated N-body simulations, provide very strong support for the
hypothesis that **the nucleus of Sgr formed independently of M54, which
probably plunged to its present position, coincident with Sgr,N, because
of significant decay of the original orbit due to dynamical friction.**

### Kunder&Chaboyer09:

We derive the distance to the northern extension of the Sagittarius
(Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy from 203 Sgr RR0 Lyrae stars found in the
MACHO database. Their distances are determined differentially with
respect to 288 Galactic bulge RR0 Lyrae stars also found in the MACHO
data. **We find a distance modulus difference of 2.41 mag at l = 5° and
b = -8° and that the extension of the Sgr galaxy toward the galactic
plane is inclined toward us.** Assuming R GC = 8 kpc, this implies the
distance to these stars is (m - M)0 = 16.97 ± 0.07 mag, which
corresponds to D = 24.8 ± 0.8 kpc. Although this estimate is smaller
than previous determinations for this galaxy and agrees with previous
suggestions that Sgr\'s body is truly closer to us, this estimate is
larger than studies at comparable galactic latitudes.

NOTE: distance calibration is tricky and the absolute distance you get
is very sensible (at D>20kpc) to small biases in metallicity. In other
words, current estimates of distance to Sgr,Nucl. is \~27kpc.

NOTE: this is not the first work that points out that the leading side
of Sgr is closer to the Sun (Alcock et al. 1996) and, therefore, to the
GC. Again, **this would mean that Sgr is NOT aligned with its orbit (see
Ibata+97).**

### Ibata et al. 2009:

We report the detection of a stellar density cusp and a velocity
dispersion increase in the center of the globular cluster M54, located
at the center of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). The central
line-of-sight velocity dispersion is 20.2 ± 0.7 km s-1, decreasing to
16.4 ± 0.4 km s-1 at 2farcs5 (0.3 pc). Modeling the kinematics and
surface density profiles as the sum of a King model and a point-mass
yields a black hole mass of \~9400 M sun. However, the observations can
alternatively be explained if the cusp stars possess moderate radial
anisotropy. A Jeans analysis of the Sgr nucleus reveals a strong
tangential anisotropy, probably a relic from the formation of the
system.

### Carraro & Bensby 2009:

A widely supported formation scenario for the Galactic disc is that it
formed inside-out from material accumulated via accretion events. The
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) is the best example of
such an accretion, and its ongoing disruption has resulted in that its
stars are being deposited in the Milky Way halo and outer disc. It is
therefore appealing to search for possible signatures of the Sgr dSph
contribution to the build-up of the Galactic disc. Interestingly, models
of the Sgr dSph stream clearly indicate that the trailing tail passes
through the outer Galactic disc, at the same Galactocentric distance as
some anticentre old open star clusters. We investigate in this Letter
the possibility that the two outermost old open clusters, Berkeley 29
and Saurer 1, could have formed inside the Sgr dSph and then left behind
in the outer Galactic disc as a result of tidal interaction with the
Milky Way. The actual location of these two star clusters, inside the
Sgr dSph trailing tail, is compatible with this scenario, and their
chemical and kinematical properties, together with our present
understanding of the age-metallicity relationship in the Sgr dSph, lend
further support to this possible association. Hence, we find it likely
that the old open star clusters, Berkeley 29 and Saurer 1, have
extragalactic origins.

**NOTE: see, e.g., Gaia Collaboration, Antoja et al. 2021 for proof that
Berkeley29 & Saurer1 are actually part of the disc, perhaps associated
with Monoceros Ring and/or ACS.**

### Yanny et al. 2009:

We show that the Sagittarius dwarf tidal stream can be traced with very
red K/M-giant stars, selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
photometry. A subset of these stars are spectroscopically confirmed with
SEGUE and SDSS spectra, and the distance scale of 2MASS and SDSS M
giants is calibrated to the RR Lyrae distance scale. The absolute
magnitude of the K/M-giant stars at the tip of the giant branch is
M\_{g_0}=-1.0. The line-of-sight velocities of the M giant and blue
horizontal-branch (BHB) stars that are spatially coincident with the Sgr
dwarf tidal stream are consistent with those of previous authors,
reinforcing the need for new models that can explain all of the Sgr
tidal debris stream observations. We estimate stellar densities along
the tidal tails that can be used to help constrain future models. **The
K/M giant, BHB, and F-turnoff stars in the lower surface brightness
tidal stream that is adjacent to the main leading Sgr dwarf tidal tail
have velocities and metallicities that are similar to those of the stars
in the leading tidal tail. The ratio of K/M giants to BHBs and BHBs to
F-turnoff stars are also similar for both branches of the leading tidal
tail.** We show that there is an additional low-metallicity tidal stream
near the Sgr trailing tidal tail.

On the bifurcation of the leading arm:

*"The (l,b) locations of the spectra with the correct velocities for Sgr
stream stars (shown in the lower panel) suggest that the two stream
branches grow further apart (in angle) as they approach the Galactic
anticenter. \[..\] There is no significant distinction between the upper
and lower branch metallicity distributions."*

NOTE: the "new" stream they mention is actually Cetus, discovered a
couple of years before this article.

NOTE: no difference in distance or vlos between the branches of the
leading bifurcation.

*"Models that explain the upper branch as debris that has orbited the
Galaxy at least one more time than the lower branch (leading tidal
tail), or at least one less time (trailing tidal tail), must also
explain the similarity in populations between these two debris streams.
Alternatively, we suggest that the two branches might be from debris
that was stripped from the Sgr dwarf galaxy at similar times."*

### Prior et al. 2009:

A sample of RR Lyrae (RRL) variables from the Southern Edgeworth-Kuiper
Belt Object survey in regions overlapping the expected position of
debris from the interaction of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy with
the Milky Way (R.A. \~ 20 and 21.5 hr distance = 16-21 kpc) has been
followed up spectroscopically and photometrically. The 21
photometrically confirmed type ab **RRLs in this region have
lang\[Fe/H\]rang = -1.79 ± 0.08 on our system, consistent with the
abundances found for RRLs in a different portion of the Sgr tidal debris
stream.** The distribution of velocities in the Galactic standard of
rest frame (V GSR) of the 26 RRLs in the region is not consistent with a
smooth halo population. Upon comparison with the Sgr disruption models
of Law et al., a prominent group of five stars having highly negative
radial velocities (V GSR \~-175 km s-1) is consistent with predictions
for old trailing debris when the Galactic halo potential is modeled as
oblate. In contrast, the prolate model does not predict any significant
number of Sgr stars at the locations of the observed sample. The
observations also require that the recent trailing debris stream has a
broader spread perpendicular to the Sgr plane than predicted by the
models. We have also investigated the possible association of the Virgo
Stellar Stream (VSS) with Sgr debris by comparing radial velocities for
RRLs in the region with the same models, finding similarities in the
velocity-position trends. As suggested by our earlier work, the stars in
the VSS region with large negative V GSR values are likely to be old
leading Sgr debris, but we find that while old trailing Sgr debris may
well make a contribution at positive V GSR values, it is unlikely to
fully account for the VSS feature. **Overall we find that further
modeling is needed, as trailing arm data generally favor oblate models
while leading arm data favor prolate models, with no single potential
fitting all the observed data.**

NOTE: they detect a couple of RR Lyrae overdensities at the contrary
value of Vgsr both in the north and south. In the south, this material
could correspond to the L1p2w of V21. Moderns samples (e.g., Yang+2019,
Penarrubia&Petersen21, Ramos+2021) do NOT have stars here. These RR
Lyrae are VERY important because they can anchor the L1p2w.

NOTE: the group of RR Lyrae in the north, they could be detecting the
normal leading and the continuation of the trailing.

### Chou et al. 2010:

We present high-resolution spectroscopic measurements of the abundances
of the α element titanium (Ti) and s-process elements yttrium (Y) and
lanthanum (La) for 59 candidate M giant members of the Sagittarius (Sgr)
dwarf spheroidal (dSph) + tidal tail system pre-selected on the basis of
position and radial velocity (RV). As expected, the majority of these
stars show peculiar abundance patterns compared to those of nominal
Milky Way (MW) stars, but as a group, the stars form a coherent picture
of chemical enrichment of the **Sgr dSph from \[Fe/H\] = -1.4 to solar
abundance**. This sample of spectra provides the largest number of Ti,
La, and Y abundances yet measured for a dSph, and spans metallicities
not typically probed by studies of the other, generally more metal-poor
MW satellites. On the other hand, the overall \[Ti/Fe\], \[Y/Fe\],
\[La/Fe\], and \[La/Y\] patterns with \[Fe/H\] of the Sgr stream plus
Sgr core do, for the most part, resemble those seen in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and other dSphs, only shifted by Δ\[Fe/H\] \~
+0.4 from the LMC and by \~+1 dex from the other dSphs; **these relative
shifts reflect the faster and/or more efficient chemical evolution of
Sgr compared to the other satellites, and show that Sgr has had an
enrichment history more like the LMC than the other dSphs.** By tracking
the evolution of the abundance patterns along the Sgr stream we can
follow the time variation of the chemical make-up of dSph stars donated
to the Galactic halo by Sgr. This evolution demonstrates that while the
bulk of the stars currently in the Sgr dSph is quite unlike those of the
Galactic halo, **an increasing number of stars farther along the Sgr
stream have abundances like MW halo stars, a trend that shows clearly
how the Galactic halo could have been contributed by present-day
satellite galaxies even if the present chemistry of those satellites is
now different from typical halo field stars.** Finally, we analyze the
chemical abundances of a moving group of M giants among the Sgr leading
arm stars at the North Galactic Cap, but having RVs unlike the infalling
Sgr leading arm debris there. **Through use of \"chemical
fingerprinting,\" we conclude that these mostly receding northern
hemisphere M giants also are Sgr stars, likely trailing arm debris
overlapping the Sgr leading arm in the north.**

NOTE: Their detection of the trailing arm in the north seems confirmed
compared to previous works (Majewski+2004, Chou+2007), and correspond
roughly to the same detections we have with modern samples.

### Pryor et al. 2010:

**We have derived a proper motion of Sagittarius using archival data
obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope.** The data consist of imaging
at three epochs with a time baseline of about four years in three
distinct fields. The zero point for the proper motion is based on the
foreground Galactic stellar populations along the line of sight. The
measured proper motion in the Galactic coordinate system is (μell, μ b )
= (-2.615 ± 0.22, 1.87 ± 0.19) mas yr-1 and in the equatorial coordinate
system is (μα, μδ) = (-2.75 ± 0.20, - 1.65 ± 0.22) mas yr-1. Removing
the contribution of the motion of the Sun and of the LSR to the measured
proper motion produces a Galactic rest-frame proper motion of (μGrf ell,
μGrf b ) = (-0.82 ± 0.22, 1.98 ± 0.19) mas yr-1 and (μGrf α, μGrf δ) =
(-2.14 ± 0.20, 0.03 ± 0.20) mas yr-1. The implied space velocity with
respect to the Galactic center is **(Π, Θ, Z) = (141.9 ± 6.9, 117 ± 29,
238 ± 27) km s-1**. This velocity implies that the instantaneous orbital
inclination is 67°, with a 95% confidence interval of (58°, 79°). We
also present photometry and membership probabilities for the stars in
our sample, which can be used to generate color-magnitude diagrams for
stellar populations selected by proper motion.

### Niederste-Ostholt et al. 2010:

What was the mass of the progenitor of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf
galaxy? Here, we reassemble the stellar debris using Sloan Digital Sky
Survey and Two Micron All-Sky Survey data to find the total luminosity
and likely mass. We find that the luminosity is in the range (9.6-13.2)
× 107 L sun or MV \~ -15.1 to -15.5, with 70% of the light residing in
the debris streams. The progenitor is somewhat fainter than the
present-day Small Magellanic Cloud, and comparable in brightness to the
M31 dwarf spheroidals NGC 147 and NGC 185. Using cosmologically
motivated models, we estimate that the mass of **Sgr\'s dark matter halo
prior to tidal disruption was \~10\^10 M sun.**

### Giuffrida et al. 2010:

Context. The Sagittarius dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Sgr dSph) provides us
with a unique possibility of studying a dwarf galaxy merging event while
still in progress. Moving along a short-period, quasi-polar orbit in the
Milky Way Halo, Sgr dSph is being tidally dispersed along a huge stellar
stream. Due to its low distance (25 kpc), the main body of Sgr dSph
covers a vast area in the sky (roughly 15 × 7 degrees). Available
photometric and spectroscopic studies have concentrated either on the
central part of the galaxy or on the stellar stream, but the
overwhelming majority of the galaxy body has never been probed.

Aims: The aim of the present study is twofold. On the one hand, to
produce color magnitude diagrams across the extension of Sgr dSph to
study its stellar populations, searching for age and/or composition
gradients (or lack thereof). On the other hand, to derive spectroscopic
low-resolution radial velocities for a subsample of stars to determine
membership to Sgr dSph for the purpose of high resolution spectroscopic
follow-up.

Methods: We used VIMOS\@VLT to produce V and I photometry on **7 fields
across the Sgr dSph minor and major axis, plus 3 more centered on the
associated globular clusters Terzan 7, Terzan 8 and Arp 2. A last field
has been centered on M 54**, lying in the center of Sgr dSph. VIMOS high
resolution spectroscopic mode has then been used to derive radial
velocities for a subsample of the observed stars, concentrating on
objects having colors and magnitudes compatible with the Sgr dSph red
giant branch.

Results: We present photometry for 320 000 stars across the main body of
Sgr dSph, one of the richest, and safely the most wide-angle sampling
ever produced for this fundamental object. We also provide robust
memberships for more than one hundred stars, whose high resolution
spectroscopic analysis will be the object of forthcoming papers. **Sgr
dSph appears remarkably uniform among the observed fields. We confirm
the presence of a main Sgr dSph population characterized roughly by the
same metallicity of 47 Tuc, but we also found the presence of multiple
populations on the peripheral fields of the galaxy, with a metallicity
spanning from \[Fe/H\] = -2.3 to a nearly solar value.**

**NOTE: what is the implication of a population uniformity within the
remnant? Usually, the gradient in population across the stream is
justified in terms of a correlation between age-metallicity-binding
energy. On the other hand, if the mix has always been homogeneous, then
this means that the stars that are NOT on the stream, were born AFTER
the corresponding pericentre passage (i.e., \<1Gyr ago).**

### Carretta et al. 2010:

We derive homogeneous abundances of Fe, O, Na, and α-elements from
high-resolution FLAMES spectra for 76 red giant stars in NGC 6715 (M54)
and for 25 red giants in the surrounding nucleus of the Sagittarius
(Sgr) dwarf galaxy. Our main findings are the following. (1) **We
confirm that M54 shows intrinsic metallicity dispersion, \~0.19 dex
rms.** (2) When the stars of the Sgr nucleus are included, the
metallicity distribution strongly resembles that in ω Cen; the relative
contribution of the most metal-rich stars is, however, different in
these two objects. (3) In both globular clusters (GCs) there is a very
extended Na-O anticorrelation, which is a signature of different stellar
generations born within the cluster. (4) The metal-poor and metal-rich
components in M54 (and ω Cen) show clearly distinct extension of the
Na-O anticorrelation, the most heavily polluted stars being those of the
metal-rich component. We propose a tentative scenario for cluster
formation that could explain these features. Finally, similarities and
differences found in the two most massive GCs in our Galaxy can be
easily explained if they are similar objects (nuclear clusters in dwarf
galaxies) observed at different stages of their dynamical evolution.

NOTE: the authors are not sure if this means that Sgr is nucleated or
not. They just say that, after the full disruption of Sgr, all that will
be left is M54 polluted with the stars at the centre of Sgr, and that
final object will resemble a lot omega Cent.

### Sollima et al. 2010:

We present new B, V and I CCD time-series photometry for 177 variable
stars in a 13 × 13arcmin2 field centred on the globular cluster M54
(lying at the centre of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy), 94 of
which are newly identified variables. The total sample is composed of
two anomalous Cepheids, 144 RR Lyrae stars (108 RR0 and 36 RR1), three
SX Phoenicis, seven eclipsing binaries (five W UMa and two Algol
binaries), three variables of uncertain classification and 18
long-period variables. The large majority of the RR Lyrae variables
likely belong to M54. Ephemerides are provided for all the observed
short-period variables. The pulsational properties of the M54 RR Lyrae
variables are close to those of Oosterhoff I clusters, but a significant
number of long-period ab type RR Lyrae are present. We use the observed
properties of RR Lyrae to estimate the reddening and the distance
modulus of M54, E(B - V) = 0.16 +/- 0.02 and (m - M)0 = 17.13 +/- 0.11,
respectively, in excellent agreement with the most recent estimates. The
metallicity has been estimated for a subset of 47 RR Lyrae stars, with
especially good quality light curves, from the Fourier parameters of the
V light curve. The derived metallicity distribution has a symmetric bell
shape, with a mean of \< \[Fe/H\]\> = - 1.65 and a standard deviation σ
= 0.16 dex. Seven stars have been identified as likely belonging to the
Sagittarius galaxy, based on their too high or too low metallicity. This
evidence, if confirmed, might suggest that old stars in this galaxy span
a wide range of metallicities.

**NOTE: again, same metallicity for the RR Lyrae in the remnant and in
the tail. RR Lyrae are a single population that has been getting
stripped since the beginning.**

### Carretta et al. 2010:

Homogeneous abundances of light elements, α-elements, and Fe-group
elements from high-resolution FLAMES spectra are presented for 76 red
giant stars in NGC 6715 (M 54), a massive globular cluster (GC) lying in
the nucleus of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. We also derived detailed
abundances for 27 red giants belonging to the Sgr nucleus. Our
abundances measure the intrinsic metallicity dispersion (\~0.19 dex, rms
scatter) of M 54, with the bulk of stars peaking at \[Fe/H\] \~ -1.6 and
a long tail extending to higher metallicities, similar to ω Cen. The
spread in these probable nuclear star clusters exceeds those of most
GCs: these massive clusters are located in a region intermediate between
normal GCs and dwarf galaxies. The GC M 54 exibits a Na-O
anticorrelation, a typical signature of GCs, which is instead absent for
the Sgr nucleus. The light elements (Mg, Al, Si) participating in the
high temperature Mg-Al cycle show that the entire pattern of
(anti)correlations produced by proton-capture reactions in H-burning is
clearly different between the most metal-rich and most metal-poor
components in the two most massive GCs in the Galaxy, confirming early
results based on the Na-O anticorrelation. As in ω Cen, stars affected
by most extreme processing, i.e. showing the signature of more massive
polluters, are those of the metal-rich component. These observations can
be understood if the burst of star formation giving birth to the
metal-rich component was delayed by as much as 10-30 Myr with respect to
the metal-poor one. **The evolution of these massive GCs can be easily
reconciled in the general scenario for the formation of GCs sketched
previously by ourselves, taking into account that ω Cen may have already
incorporated the surrounding nucleus of its progenitor and lost the
remainder of the hosting galaxy while the two are still observable as
distinct components in M 54 and the surrounding field.**

### Keller et al. 2010:

We present abundances of C, O, Ti, and Fe for 11 M-giant stars in the
trailing tidal arm of the Sagittarius dwarf (Sgr). The abundances were
derived by comparing synthetic spectra with high-resolution infrared
spectra obtained with the Phoenix spectrograph on the Gemini South
telescope. The targeted stars are drawn from two regions of the Sgr
trailing arm separated by 66° (five stars) and 132° (six stars) from the
main body of Sgr. The trailing arm provides a more direct diagnostic of
the chemical evolution of Sgr compared to the extensively phase-mixed
leading arm. **Within our restricted sample of \~2-3 Gyr old stars, we
find that the stream material exhibits a significant metallicity
gradient of -(2.4 ± 0.3) × 10-3 dex/degree** (-(9.4 ± 1.1) × 10-4
dex/kpc) away from the main body of Sgr. The tidal disruption of Sgr is
a relatively recent event. **We therefore interpret the presence of a
metallicity gradient in the debris as indicative of a similar gradient
in the progenitor.** The fact that such a metallicity gradient survived
for almost a Hubble time indicates that the efficiency of radial mixing
was very low in the Sgr progenitor. No significant gradient is seen to
exist in the \[α/Fe\] abundance ratio along the trailing arm. Our
results may be accounted for by a radial decrease in star formation
efficiency and/or radial increase in the efficiency of galactic
wind-driven metal loss in the chemical evolution of the Sgr progenitor.
The \[Ti/Fe\] and \[O/Fe\] abundance ratios observed within the stream
are distinct from those of the Galactic halo. We conclude that the
fraction of the intermediate to metal-rich halo population contributed
by the recent dissolution (\<3 Gyr) of Sgr-like dwarf galaxies cannot be
substantial.

NOTE: I don't understand the need for the metallicity gradient to
survive for a Hubble time when, clearly, the stars they study were
formed recently.

NOTE: The gradient they measure (consistent with more recent studies) is
significant but extremely small. Plus, over the range sampled, one does
NOT expect any significant gradient in initial radius (based on V21).
Therefore, the metallicity gradient observed is NOT a product of a
correlation between initial radius and metallicity.

### Correnti et al. 2010:

We trace the tidal Stream of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy
(Sgr dSph) using Red Clump (RC) stars from the catalog of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey-Data Release 6, in the range 150° \<\~ R.A. \<\~
220°, corresponding to the range of orbital azimuth 220° \<\~ Λ \<\~
290°. Substructures along the line of sight (los) are identified as
significant peaks in the differential star count profiles (SCPs) of
candidate RC stars. A proper modeling of the SCPs allows us to obtain
(1) \<=10% accurate, purely differential distances with respect to the
main body of Sgr, (2) estimates of the FWHM along the los, and (3)
estimates of the local density, for each detected substructure. In the
range 255° \<\~ Λ \<\~ 290° we cleanly and continuously trace various
coherent structures that can be ascribed to the Stream, in particular:
the well-known northern portion of the leading arm, running from d \~=
43 kpc at Λ \~= 290° to d \~= 30 kpc at Λ \~= 255°, and **a more nearby
coherent series of detections lying at a constant distance d \~= 25 kpc,
that can be identified with a wrap of the trailing arm. The latter
structure, predicted by several models of the disruption of Sgr dSph,
was never traced before;** comparison with existing models indicates
that the difference in distance between these portions of the leading
and trailing arms may provide a powerful tool to discriminate between
theoretical models assuming different shapes of the Galactic potential.
A further, more distant wrap in the same portion of the sky is detected
only along a couple of los. For Λ \<\~ 255° the detected structures are
more complex and less easily interpreted. We are confident of being able
to trace the continuation of the leading arm down to Λ \~= 220° and d
\~= 20 kpc the trailing arm is seen up to Λ \~= 240° where it is
replaced by more distant structures. Possible detections of more nearby
wraps and of the Virgo Stellar Stream are also discussed. These measured
properties provide a coherent set of observational constraints for the
next generation of theoretical models of the disruption of Sgr.

NOTE: the detection of the trailing arm at \~25kpc seems weird. i) their
method starts to be sensible at that distance. ii) no recent detections
of the stream report this and iii) recent models of the stream predict
this. In fact, V21 predicts the trailing arm farther than that, and the
second wrap of the leading, closer. **The detection seems robust
though... is the V21 model wrong?**

![](.//media/image12.png){width="6.270833333333333in"

**NOTE: based on the comparison of the fields A and B with the V21
model, it would seem like they detected the trailing arm. However, right
after it passes the leading arm at l>300deg, the model does not match
the data any more. Is it a problem of the method? Should we anchor the
trailing to these detections?**

### Peñarrubia+11:

We have conducted a spectroscopic survey of the inner regions of the
Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy using the AAOmega spectrograph on the
Anglo-Australian Telescope. We determine radial velocities for over 1800
Sgr star members in six fields that cover an area 18.84 deg2, with a
typical accuracy of ≈2 km s-1. Motivated by recent numerical models of
the Sgr tidal stream that predict a substantial amount of rotation in
the dwarf remnant core, we compare the kinematic data against N-body
models that simulate the stream progenitor as (1) a pressure-supported,
mass-follows-light system and (2) a late-type, rotating disk galaxy
embedded in an extended dark matter halo. **We find that the models with
little or no intrinsic rotation clearly yield a better match to the mean
line-of-sight velocity in all surveyed fields, but fail to reproduce the
shape of the line-of-sight velocity distribution.** This result rules
out models wherein the prominent bifurcation observed in the leading
tail of the Sgr stream was caused by a transfer from intrinsic angular
momentum from the progenitor satellite into the tidal stream. It also
implies that the trajectory of the young tidal tails has not been
affected by internal rotation in the progenitor system. Our finding
indicates that new, more elaborate dynamical models, in which the dark
and luminous components are treated independently, are necessary for
simultaneously reproducing both the internal kinematics of the Sgr dwarf
and the available data for the associated tidal stream.

*"dSph is most likely pressure supported (no net rotation) as seen by
line of sight velocities."*

**NOTES: based on the results of Lokas+10, it's not true that the lack
of intrinsic rotation today rules out a disky origin for Sgr. Plus, as
they say, their model fails to reproduce the shape of the line-of-sight
velocity distribution. Clearly, there's more to it.**

### Ruhland et al. 2011:

We use a sample of blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 to explore the structure of the tidal
tails from the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy. We use a method yielding BHB
star candidates with up to \~70% purity from photometry alone. The
resulting sample has a distance precision of roughly 5% and can probe
distances in excess of 100 kpc. Using this sample, **we identify a
possible extension to the trailing arm at distances of 60-80 kpc from
the Sun** with an estimated significance of at least 3.8σ. **Current
models predict that a distant \"returning\" segment of the debris stream
should exist, but place it substantially closer to the Sun where no
debris is observed in our data.** Exploiting the distance precision of
our tracers, we estimate the mean line-of-sight thickness of the leading
arm to be \~3 kpc, **and show that the two \"bifurcated\" branches of
the debris stream differ by only 1-2 kpc in distance.** With a
spectroscopic very pure BHB star subsample, we estimate **the velocity
dispersion in the leading arm, 37 km s-1**, which is in reasonable
agreement with models of Sgr disruption. We finally present a sample of
high-probability Sgr BHB stars in the leading arm of Sgr, selected to
have distances and velocities consistent with Sgr membership, to allow
further study.

NOTES: first actual proof that the leading arm extends farther than
predicted by the models.

### Siegel et al. 2011:

We use observations from the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for
Surveys (HST/ACS) study of Galactic globular clusters to investigate the
spatial distribution of the inner regions of the disrupting Sagittarius
dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr). We combine previously published analyses
of four Sgr member clusters located near or in the Sgr core (M54, Arp 2,
Terzan 7, and Terzan 8) with a new analysis of diffuse Sgr material
identified in the background of five low-latitude Galactic bulge
clusters (NGC 6624, 6637, 6652, 6681, and 6809) observed as part of the
ACS survey. By comparing the bulge cluster color-magnitude diagrams to
our previous analysis of the M54/Sgr core, we estimate distances to
these background features. The combined data from four Sgr member
clusters and five Sgr background features provide nine independent
measures of the Sgr distance and, as a group, provide uniformly measured
and calibrated probes of different parts of the inner regions of Sgr
spanning 20° over the face of the disrupting dwarf. This allows us,
**for the first time, to constrain the three-dimensional orientation of
Sgr\'s disrupting core and globular cluster system and compare that
orientation to the predictions of an N-body model of tidal disruption.**
The density and distance of Sgr debris are consistent with models that
favor **a relatively high Sgr core mass and a slightly greater distance
(28-30 kpc, with a mean of 29.4 kpc).** **Our analysis also suggests
that M54 is in the foreground of Sgr by \~2 kpc, projected on the center
of the Sgr dSph.** While this would imply a remarkable alignment of the
cluster and the Sgr nucleus along the line of sight, we cannot identify
any systematic effect in our analysis that would falsely create the
measured 2 kpc separation. **Finally, we find that the cluster Terzan 7
has the most discrepant distance (25 kpc) among the four Sgr core
clusters, which may suggest a different dynamical history than the other
Sgr core clusters.**

*"The N-body model of LM10a makes specific predictions about the
relationship between sky position and line-of-sight distance for the
disrupting Sgr dwarf. In the model, emerging debris in the trailing arm
(positive Λ values) is slightly more distant than emerging debris in the
leading arm (negative Λ). This reflects the energy of the debris lost to
the tails. The leading stream falls inside the orbital path and the
angular momentum moves it ahead of Sgr along the orbit. The trailing
stream falls outside the orbital path and the angular momentum moves it
behind Sgr. "*

NOTE: their measurements are based on the Sgr contamination detected
around known clusters.

### Carlin et al. 2012:

We present three-dimensional (3D) kinematics of Sagittarius (Sgr)
trailing tidal debris in six fields located 70°-130° along the stream
from the Sgr dwarf galaxy core. The data are from our proper-motion (PM)
survey of Kapteyn\'s Selected Areas, in which **we have measured
accurate PMs to faint magnitudes in \~40\' × 40\' fields** evenly spaced
across the sky. The radial velocity (RV) signature of Sgr has been
identified among our follow-up spectroscopic data in four of the six
fields and combined with mean PMs of spectroscopically confirmed members
to derive space motions of Sgr debris based on \~15-64 confirmed stream
members per field. These kinematics are compared to predictions of the
Law & Majewski model of Sgr disruption; **we find reasonable agreement
with model predictions in RVs and PMs along Galactic latitude.**
**However, an upward adjustment of the local standard of rest velocity
(ΘLSR) from its standard 220 km s-1 to at least 232 ± 14 km s-1 (and
possibly as high as 264 ± 23 km s-1) is necessary to bring 3D model
debris kinematics and our measurements into agreement.** Satisfactory
model fits that simultaneously reproduce known position, distance, and
RV trends of the Sgr tidal streams, while significantly increasing ΘLSR,
could only be achieved by increasing the Galactic bulge and disk mass
while leaving the dark matter halo fixed to the best-fit values from Law
& Majewski. **We derive low-resolution spectroscopic abundances along
this stretch of the Sgr stream and find a constant \[Fe/H\] \~ -1.15
(with \~0.5 dex scatter in each field---typical for dwarf galaxy
populations) among the four fields with reliable measurements. A
constant metallicity suggests that debris along the \~60° span of this
study was all stripped from Sgr on the same orbital passage.**

NOTES: based on their footprints, they are studying the young leading
and trailing arms.

### Salinas et al. 2012:

We present BV photometry of four Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy
globular clusters: Arp 2, NGC 5634, Palomar 12 and Terzan 8, obtained
with the Danish Telescope at ESO La Silla. We measure the structural
parameters of the clusters using a King profile fitting, obtaining the
**first reliable measurements of the tidal radius of Arp 2 and Terzan
8.** These two clusters are **remarkably extended and with low
concentrations**; with a concentration of only c= 0.41 ± 0.02, Terzan 8
is less concentrated than any cluster in our Galaxy.

Blue stragglers are identified in the four clusters, and their spatial
distribution is compared to those of horizontal branch and red giant
branch stars. **The blue straggler properties do not provide evidence of
mass segregation in Terzan 8, while Arp 2 probably shares the same
status**, although with less confidence. In the case of **NGC 5634 and
Palomar 12, blue stragglers are significantly less populous, and their
analysis suggests that the two clusters have probably undergone mass
segregation.**

### Koposov et al. 2012

The structure of the Sagittarius stream in the southern Galactic
hemisphere is analyzed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8.
**Parallel to the Sagittarius tidal track, but \~10° away, there is
another fainter and more metal-poor stream.** We provide evidence that
the two streams follow similar distance gradients but have distinct
morphological properties and stellar populations. **The brighter stream
is broader, contains more metal-rich stars, and has a richer
color-magnitude diagram with multiple turnoffs and a prominent red clump
as compared to the fainter stream.** Based on the structural properties
and the stellar population mix, **the stream configuration is similar to
the Northern \"bifurcation.\"** In the region of the South Galactic Cap,
there is overlapping tidal debris from the Cetus stream, which crosses
the Sagittarius stream. Using both photometric and spectroscopic data,
we show that the blue straggler population belongs mainly to Sagittarius
and the blue horizontal branch stars belong mainly to the Cetus stream
in this confused location in the halo.

*"Our modeling of the cross-sections of the density suggests the
existence of a thicker brighter stream and a thinner fainter stream,
offset by ∼10◦. **The streams differ in integrated luminosity by a
factor of 5--10.** There is also strong evidence that the two streams
have different metallicity distribution functions"*

NOTES: the faint branches DO have metal rich stars, but much less.

*"The simplest explanation is that the southern faint stream is part of
the same structure as the northern faint stream. \[..\] is it possible
to produce the streams with the properties described in this paper in a
disruption of one galaxy or is more than one progenitor necessary?"*

*"Moreover, in the scenario of Penarrubia et al. (2010) the two streams
are not expected to differ significantly in their stellar populations
content."*

NOTES: I STRONGLY DISAGREE.

*"Finally, it is tempting to suggest that the two streams with different
properties have actually originated from two different progenitors. The
infall of satellites in groups is not particular but general, as best
illustrated by the recent arrival of the LMC and SMC."*

NOTES: the populations are too similar, the secondary object should be
quite massive AND its stream should cross Sgr stream at some point,
which it doesn't.

### Carrell et al. 2012:

We have probed a section (l \~ 150, b \~ -60) of the trailing tidal arm
of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy by identifying a sample of
Red Clump (RC) stream stars. RC stars are not generally found in the
halo field, but are found in significant numbers in both the Sagittarius
galaxy and its tidal streams, making them excellent probes of stream
characteristics. Our target sample was selected using photometric data
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Data Release 6, which was constrained
in color to match the Sagittarius RC stars. Spectroscopic observations
of the target stars were conducted at Kitt Peak National Observatory
using the WIYN telescope. The resulting spectroscopic sample is
magnitude limited and contains both main-sequence disk stars and evolved
RC stars. We have developed a method to systematically separate these
two stellar classes using kinematic information and a Bayesian approach
for surface gravity determination. The resulting RC sample allows us to
determine an absolute stellar density of **ρ = 2.7 ± 0.5 RC stars
kpc-3** at this location in the stream. Future measurements of stellar
densities for a variety of populations and at various locations along
the streams will lead to a much improved understanding of the original
nature of the Sagittarius galaxy and the physical processes controlling
its disruption and subsequent stream generation.

### Frinchaboy et al. 2012:

We have assembled a large-area spectroscopic survey of giant stars in
the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy core. Using medium resolution (R \~
15,000), multifiber spectroscopy we have measured velocities of these
stars, which extend up to 12° from the galaxy\'s center (3.7 core radii
or 0.4 times the King limiting radius). From these high-quality spectra
we identify 1310 Sgr members out of 2296 stars surveyed, distributed
across 24 different fields across the Sgr core. Additional slit spectra
were obtained of stars bridging from the Sgr core to its trailing tail.
Our systematic, large-area sample shows no evidence for significant
rotation, a result at odds with the \~20 km s-1 rotation required as an
explanation for the bifurcation seen in the Sgr tidal stream; **the
observed small (\<=4 km s-1)** velocity trend primarily along the major
axis is consistent with models of the projected motion of an extended
body on the sky with no need for intrinsic rotation. The Sgr core is
found to have a flat velocity dispersion (except for a kinematically
colder center point) across its surveyed extent and into its tidal
tails, a property that matches the velocity dispersion profiles measured
for other Milky Way dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We comment on the
possible significance of this observed kinematical similarity for the
dynamical state of the other classical Milky Way dSphs in light of the
fact that Sgr is clearly a strongly tidally disrupted system.

*"1) The Sgr central velocity dispersion is found to be 9.9 ± 0.7 km
s−1, in agreement with the dispersion (9.6 ± 0.4 km s−1) found by
Bellazzini et al. (2008) after removing stars associated with M54 (e.g.,
Figure 4, Section 4). This central velocity dispersion is not atypical
among the "classical" dSph galaxies (see Table 6).*

*2) Within the distribution of RVs, we find no signatures of rotation
along the minor axis of Sgr. With a detailed investigation of trends
along the major axis, we find evidence for at most a small trend (4 km
s−1 deg−1), though even this small effect can be explained without
needing intrinsic rotation, as shown by various adopted models of an
extended Sgr system moving along its orbit. Thus, we confirm that Sgr is
like other dSphs in having no significant rotation (vrot/σ(v) 1)
signature along any axis (e.g., Figures 10, Section 4)."*

**NOTE: the authors agree that the model presented in Lokas+2010 is
consistent with their data and deem it "the first model to explain both
the very large ellipticity of Sgr as well as the observed kinematics of
its stars".**

*"\[..\] the velocity dispersion profile for Sgr as a function of radius
for the data presented in this study also strongly imitates those for
other MW dSphs. Just like the velocity dispersion profiles of the other
classical MW dSphs, that of Sgr remains more or less flat to large
radii, including that part of the system where it is clearly dominated
by tidal debris."*

### McDonald et al. 2012:

We present spectra of 1142 colour-selected stars in the direction of the
Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal (Sgr dSph) galaxy, of which 1058 were taken
with VLT/FLAMES multi-object spectrograph and 84 were taken with the
SAAO Radcliffe 1.9-m telescope grating spectrograph. Spectroscopic
membership is confirmed (at \>99 per cent confidence) for 592 stars on
the basis of their radial velocity, and spectral types are given. **Very
slow rotation is marginally detected around the galaxy\'s major axis**.
We identify five S stars and 23 carbon stars, of which all but four
carbon stars are newly determined and all but one (PQ Sgr) are likely
Sgr dSph members. We examine the onset of carbon richness in this
metal-poor galaxy in the context of stellar models. We compare the
stellar death rate (one star per 1000-1700 yr) with the known planetary
nebula dynamical ages and find that the bulk population produce the
observed (carbon-rich) planetary nebulae. We compute average lifetimes
of S and carbon stars as 60-250 and 130-500 kyr, compared to a total
thermal-pulsing asymptotic giant branch lifetime of 530-1330 kyr. We
conclude by discussing the return of carbon-rich material to the
interstellar medium.

### Slater et al. 2013:

We use data from the Pan-STARRS1 survey to present a panoramic view of
the Sagittarius tidal stream in the southern Galactic hemisphere. As a
result of the extensive sky coverage of Pan-STARRS1, the southern stream
is visible along more than 60° of its orbit, nearly double the length
seen by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. T**he recently discovered southern
bifurcation of the stream is also apparent, with the fainter branch of
the stream visible over at least 30°.** Using a combination of fitting
both the main-sequence turnoff and the red clump, we measure the
distance to both arms of the stream in the south. **We find that the
distances to the bright arm of the stream agree very well with the
N-body models of Law & Majewski. We also find that the faint arm lies
\~5 kpc closer to the Sun than the bright arm, similar to the behavior
seen in the northern hemisphere.**

NOTE: their detection of the faint arm in the trailing, based on the
counts shown in Fig.1, is more than questionable. But, if we trust that,
then their distance distribution is the next questionable thing. There
is a lot of scatter and yet they claim a separation of \~5kpc, which is
NOT observed in the leading bifurcation: in Ruhland+11, they put an
upper limit of \<1-2kpc. In Yanny+09, there is no difference whatsoever
between Figures 15 and 16. The last reference they use to argue that
there is a distance difference in the north is Niederste-Ostholt+10,
where they DO NOT measure anything new, just re-using the measurements
by Belokurov+06. In those measurements, there is a slight preference of
the faint branch to be closer to the Sun, but the difference is much
smaller than the uncertainties. Overall, it's quite bold to take for
granted that there is a difference in distance between branches in the
northern bifurcation. As for the south... This is the first work where
they measure it. There's nothing on distance difference in Koposov+12,
and 5kpc should be noticeable in their CMDs. Future works like
Navarrete+17 and Hernitschek+17 do seem to find a bimodality in the
distance distribution. In the case of the latter, no trace of
bifurcation is found (because of the use of RR Lyrae), which kinda means
that the distance bimodality has nothing to do with the bifurcation. As
for Navarrete+17, it's not clear which values should be used to measure
the distance between branches since comparing SGB1 or SGB2 gives
discrepant differential distance moduli. It would seem like this \~5kpc
difference can be seen both in the bright and faint branches. Need to
follow up...

From Navarrete+17: *"Note that, according to Slater et al. (2013), there
could also be a difference in the heliocentric distances to the two
branches, of the order of ∼5 kpc"*

### Drake et al. 2013:

We present the analysis of 1207 RR Lyrae found in photometry taken by
the Catalina Survey\'s Mount Lemmon telescope. By combining accurate
distances for these stars with measurements for \~14,000 type-ab RR
Lyrae from the Catalina Schmidt telescope, **we reveal an extended
association that reaches Galactocentric distances beyond 100 kpc and
overlaps the Sagittarius stream system.** This result confirms earlier
evidence for the existence of an outer halo tidal stream resulting from
a disrupted stellar system. By comparing the RR Lyrae source density
with that expected based on halo models, we find the detection has \~8σ
significance. We investigate the distances, radial velocities,
metallicities, and period-amplitude distribution of the RR Lyrae. **We
find that both radial velocities and distances are inconsistent with
current models of the Sagittarius stream.** We also find tentative
evidence for a division in source metallicities for the most distant
sources. Following prior analyses, we compare the locations and
distances of the RR Lyrae with photometrically selected candidate
horizontal branch stars and find supporting evidence that this structure
spans at least 60° of the sky. We investigate the prospects of an
association between the stream and the unusual globular cluster NGC
2419.

*"We have investigated the possible relationship between the Gemini
tidal stream and NGC 2419 as first proposed by Newberg et al. (2003).
The most recent analysis of NGC 2419 shows significant **evidence for it
being the nuclear remnant of a disrupted dwarf galax**y (van den Bergh &
Mackey 2004; Mackey & van den Bergh 2005; Cohen et al. 2010, 2011;
Forbes & Bridges 2010; Cohen & Kirby 2012). Although, we find that the
distances of many of the RRLs and HB candidates are consistent with NGC
2419, **the available velocities and location of the Gemini stream are
not in sufficient agreement to link the two structures.**"*

### Koposov et al. 2013:

Using multi-epoch observations of the Stripe 82 region from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we measure precise statistical proper motions
of the stars in the Sagittarius (Sgr) stellar stream. The multi-band
photometry and SDSS radial velocities allow us to efficiently select Sgr
members and thus enhance the proper-motion precision to \~0.1 mas yr-1.
We measure separately the proper motion of a photometrically selected
sample of the main-sequence turn-off stars, as well as spectroscopically
selected Sgr giants. The data allow us to determine the proper motion
separately for the two Sgr streams in the south found in Koposov et al.
Together with the precise velocities from SDSS, our proper motions
provide exquisite constraints of the three-dimensional motions of the
stars in the Sgr streams.

NOTE: basically, they have a complex set-up to get proper motions along
a small portion of the trailing arm. The proper motions of the bright &
faint, both, agree well with the predictions of LM10 (in this part of
the stream, LM10 pms are a good prediction, see Antoja+20). In fact,
their measurement of the proper motion of the faint (field FP1) is dead
centre of the proper motion track of the bright branch at that Lambda
(Ramos in prep.).

### Battinelli & Demers 2013:

Context. Stars have been forming in massive dwarf spheroidal galaxies
continuously for several Gyr. The detection of AGB carbon stars
indicates that an intermediate-age population is present. Sagittarius,
the most massive, contains some 100 carbon stars. Most of them are
probably variable.

Aims: Using photometric monitoring we intend to detect long period
variables among Sagittarius carbon stars. We should be able to identify
mira variables, semi-regular and irregular variables, and to determine
their period and age group.

Methods: We have obtained K and J images over four semesters. These
images are centered on a sample of 27 photometrically identified C stars
to follow their variation and determine their periodicity.

Results: We have established the period of 14 program stars and have
identified 13 miras among them. From their periods **we determined that
most of them are in the 3-5 Gyr age group.**

Conclusions: **The known miras, distributed over a wide area within
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr), belong to populations of
various ages and, most probably, various metallicities.**

### Newby et al. 2013:

We measure the spatial density of F turnoff stars in the Sagittarius
dwarf tidal stream, from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, using
statistical photometric parallax. We find a set of continuous,
consistent parameters that describe the leading Sgr stream\'s position,
direction, and width for 15 stripes in the north Galactic cap, and three
stripes in the south Galactic cap. We produce a catalog of stars that
has the density characteristics of the dominant leading Sgr tidal stream
that can be compared with simulations. **We find that the width of the
leading (north) tidal tail is consistent with recent triaxial and
axisymmetric halo model simulations.** The density along the stream is
roughly consistent with common disruption models in the north, but
possibly not in the south. **We explore the possibility that one or more
of the dominant Sgr streams has been misidentified, and that one or more
of the \"bifurcated\" pieces is the real Sgr tidal tail,** [but we do
not reach definite conclusions]{.underline}. I**f two dwarf progenitors
are assumed, fits to the planes of the dominant and \"bifurcated\" tidal
tails favor an association of the Sgr dwarf spheroidal galaxy with the
dominant southern stream and the \"bifurcated\" stream in the north.**
In the north Galactic cap, the best fit Hernquist density profile for
the smooth component of the stellar halo is oblate, with a flattening
parameter q = 0.53, and a scale length of r 0 = 6.73. **The southern
data for both the tidal debris and the smooth component of the stellar
halo do not match the model fits to the north,** although the stellar
halo is still overwhelmingly oblate. Finally, we verify that we can
reproduce the parameter fits on the asynchronous MilkyWay\@home
volunteer computing platform.

*"By fitting planes to the dominant Sgr streams (Table 6), and to the
bifurcated pieces as described in other works, **we conclude that it is
difficult to reconcile the large discrepancy between the thick stream
planes (15.◦6 ± 0.◦1) and the presumed bifurcated pieces (3.◦9 ± 2.◦2)**
if one assumes the Sgr dwarf galaxy is the sole progenitor. If one
assumes the tidal debris comes from the disruption of two dwarf
galaxies, the plane analysis favors an association of the dominant
trailing stream and the "bifurcated" northern stream with the Sgr dwarf.
This is the opposite conclusion of the stream width analysis, which
favors an association of the dominant northern tidal tail and the Sgr
dwarf."*

### McDonald et al. 2013:

We present the deepest near-infrared (ZJKs) photometry yet obtained of
the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph), using Visible and Infrared
Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) to survey **11 square degrees
centred on its core.** We list locations and ZJKs-band magnitudes for
over 2.9 million sources in the field. We discuss the isolation of the
Sgr dSph from the foreground and Galactic Bulge populations, identify
the Sgr dSph\'s horizontal branch in the near-infrared for the first
time and map the density of the galaxy\'s stars. We present isochrones
for the Sgr dSph and Bulge populations. **These are consistent with the
previously reported properties of the Sgr dSph core: namely that it is
dominated by a population between \[Fe/H\] ≈ -1 dex and solar, with a
significant \[α/Fe\] versus \[Fe/H\] gradient.** While strong
contamination from the Galactic Bulge prevents accurate measurement of
the (Galactic) north side of the Sgr dSph, the dwarf galaxy can be well
approximated by a roughly ovaloid projection of characteristic size 4° ×
2°, beyond which the projected stellar density is less than half that of
the region surrounding the core. The galaxy\'s major axis is
perpendicular to the Galactic Plane, as in previous studies. **We find
slight evidence to confirm a metallicity gradient in the Sgr dSph and
use isochrones to fit a distance of 24.3 ± 2.3 kpc.** We were unable to
fully constrain the metallicity distribution of the Sgr dSph due to the
Bulge contamination and strong correlation of \[α/Fe\] with metallicity;
however, **we find that metal-poor stars (\[Fe/H\] ≲ -1) make up ≲29 per
cent of the Sgr dSph\'s upper red giant branch population**. The Bulge
population is best fitted by a younger population with \[Fe/H\] ≈ 0 and
\[α/Fe\] ≈ 0 or slightly higher. We find no evidence for a split,
peanut- or X-shaped Bulge population in this line of sight (l = 5.6° ±
∼1°, b = -14.1° ± ∼3°).

### McWilliam et al. 2013:

From chemical abundance analysis of stars in the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal galaxy (Sgr), we conclude that **the α-element deficiencies
cannot be due to the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) time-delay scenario of
Tinsley**. Instead, **the evidence points to low \[α/Fe\] ratios
resulting from an initial mass function (IMF) deficient in the highest
mass stars.** The critical evidence is the 0.4 dex deficiency of
\[O/Fe\], \[Mg/Fe\], and other hydrostatic elements, contrasting with
the normal trend of r-process \[Eu/Fe\] r with \[Fe/H\]. Supporting
evidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) \[X/Fe\]
ratios, which are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW)
disk trends. Also, the ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti)
element abundances suggests a relatively **top-light IMF**. Abundance
similarities with the LMC, Fornax, and IC 1613 suggest that their
α-element deficiencies also resulted from IMFs lacking the most massive
SNe II. The top-light IMF, as well as the normal trend of r-process
\[Eu/Fe\] r with \[Fe/H\] in Sgr, indicates that **massive SNe II (>30 M
⊙) are not major sources of r-process elements**. High \[La/Y\] ratios,
consistent with leaky-box chemical evolution, are confirmed but \~0.3
dex larger than theoretical asymptotic giant branch (AGB) predictions.
**This suggests that a substantial increase in the theoretical Carbon-13
pocket in low-mass AGB stars is required**. Sgr has the lowest \[Rb/Zr\]
ratios known, consistent with pollution by low-mass (\< 2 M ⊙) AGB stars
near \[Fe/H\] = -0.6, likely resulting from leaky-box chemical
evolution. The \[Cu/O\] trends in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields
increase with both metallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu
production by the weak s-process in massive stars. Finally, we present
an updated hyperfine splitting line list, an abundance analysis of
Arcturus, and further develop our error analysis formalism.

### Carretta et al. 2014:

Massive globular clusters (GCs) contain at least two generations of
stars with slightly different ages and clearly distinct light element
abundances. The Na-O anticorrelation is the best studied chemical
signature of multiple stellar generations. Instead, low-mass clusters
usually appear to be chemically homogeneous. We are investigating
low-mass GCs to understand what the lower mass limit is where multiple
populations can form, mainly using the Na and O abundance distribution.
We used VLT/FLAMES spectra of giants in the low-mass, metal-poor GC
Terzan 8 that belongs to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy to determine
abundances of Fe, O, Na, α-, Fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements in
six stars observed with UVES and 14 observed with GIRAFFE. The **average
metallicity is \[Fe/H\] = -2.27 ± 0.03** (rms = 0.08), based on the six
high-resolution UVES spectra. **Only one star**, observed with GIRAFFE,
**shows an enhanced abundance of Na** and we tentatively **assign it to
the second generation**. In this cluster, unlike what happens in more
massive GCs, **the second generation seems to represent at most a
minority fraction**. We discuss the implications of our findings,
comparing Terzan 8 with the other Sgr dSph GCs, and to GCs and field
stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, Fornax, and in other dwarfs
galaxies.

### Belokurov et al. 2014:

Using a variety of stellar tracers - blue horizontal branch stars,
main-sequence turn-off stars and red giants - we follow the path of the
Sagittarius (Sgr) stream across the sky in Sloan Digital Sky Survey
data. Our study presents new Sgr debris detections, accurate distances
and line-of-sight velocities that together help to shed new light on the
puzzle of the Sgr tails. For both the leading and the trailing tails, we
trace the points of their maximal extent, or apocentric distances, and
find that they lie at R(Lead) = 47.8 ± 0.5 kpc and R(Trail) = 102.5 ±
2.5 kpc, respectively. **The angular difference between the apocentres
is 93.2° ± 3.5°**, which is smaller than predicted for logarithmic
haloes. **Such differential orbital precession can be made consistent
with models of the Milky Way in which the dark matter density falls more
quickly with radius**. However, currently, no existing Sgr disruption
simulation can explain the entirety of the observational data. Based on
its position and radial velocity, we show that **the unusually large
globular cluster NGC 2419 can be associated with the Sgr trailing
stream**. We measure the precession of the orbital plane of the Sgr
debris in the Milky Way potential and show that, surprisingly, **Sgr
debris in the primary (brighter) tails evolves differently from the
secondary (fainter) tails, both in the north and the south.**

***"The BHB distribution \[in the northern hemisphere\] appears double
peaked, while the more metal-rich RGB profile peaks at B ∼ −5◦. This
behaviour is reminiscent of the recent measurement of the trailing
debris in the Galactic south by Koposov et al. (2012), who detect the
similar metallicity difference between the stream components at positive
and negative B"***

NOTE: based on this, the ratio BHB to RGB should change between
branches.

*"Newberg et al. (2003) show that, within the Sgr debris plane, an
overdensity of BHBs at distances similar to that of NGC 2419 can be seen
in the SDSS photometric data. The significance of this BHB overdensity
was confirmed recently by Ruhland et al. (2011). Given the proximity of
the stream and the cluster, Newberg et al. (2003) speculate that the
cluster was once part of the Sgr galaxy. Casetti-Dinescu et al. (2009)
on the other hand link the cluster with the Virgo stellar stream (which
is, most likely, a part of the Virgo overdensity) on the basis of the
cluster's proximity to the very eccentric orbit predicted from the
measured mean radial velocity and the proper motion of the stream. In
this paper, we have shown that **NGC 2419** does lie close to the plane
of the Sgr tidal debris."*

*"The rate with which an orbit precesses in a spherically symmetric
gravitational potential depends primarily on how quickly the mass
generating the gravity field decays with radius. For example, in
Keplerian potentials, the precession angle is 0◦ to ensure that the
orbits are closed after one period, while in logarithmic haloes, the
precession is ∼120◦. \[..\] The precession rate is not solely dependent
on the mass decay rate in the host, it is also a weak function of the
orbital energy and angular momentum (see equation 3.18 in Binney &
Tremaine 2008)"*

height="1.3888888888888888in"}

NOTE: this precession refers to the angular separation between
consecutives apocentres along the orbital rosette, i.e., **Apsidal
precession.** This is NOT the precession of the orbital plane,
understood as a change in the orientation of the rotational axis, as
there is none in a spherical unperturbed potential.

*"It is not possible to measure the precession of the Sgr progenitor's
orbit directly, but the angle between the leading and the trailing
apocentres encodes the necessary information."*

NOTE: is it, though? It is known that hot streams do not follow the
orbit exactly (Sanders&Binney13). Plus, the apocentre of the leading is
marked by the second pericentre material, while the apo of the trailing
is marked by the first peri material (based on V21 model).

"*The leading apocentre is at Lambda = 71.◦3 ± 3.◦5, where it reaches
Rgc = 47.8 ± 0.5 kpc. Trailing tail's apocentre is at Lambda = 170.◦5 ±
1◦ and Rgc = 102.5 ± 2.5 kpc. \[..\] , the differential orbital
precession between the leading and the trailing apocentres is δ˜ = 99.◦3
± 3.◦5. Taking into account the Sun's distance from the centre of the
Galaxy R0 = 8 kpc, **the Galactocentric δ˜ GC = 93.◦2 ± 3.◦5.***"

*"The angle through which the orbit turns from one apocentre to the next
is largely controlled by the radial profile of the potential. Our
measured value is inconsistent with a flat rotation curve, or
logarithmic potential, and indicates that the Milky Way's dark matter
density falls off more quickly than isothermal."*

"*How fast does the plane of the debris precess? Johnston et al. (2005)
show that the M giants in the leading and the trailing tails define
Galactocentric planes whose poles are ∼10◦ apart. \[..\] The left-hand
panel of Fig. 13 gives the contours of the pole density for each piece
of Branches A and B. \[..\] The precession of the leading pole is in the
direction of increasing*

*longitude (GC) and decreasing latitude (GC), the same direction as
identified by Johnston et al. (2005). \[..\] we can conclude with
certainty that the amplitude of the precession of the plane of the
leading debris (bright branch) over ∼100◦ along the stream ought to be
less than ∼10◦. \[..\] the sense of precession of the Branch B debris
pole is opposite to that of Branch A. As one steps along the leading
tail away from the remnant in the direction of Sgr motion, the Branch B
pole moves in the direction of decreasing l and decreasing b. \[..\]
Overall, the poles of the debris in the bright trailing stream at 240◦
\< Lambda \< 280◦ have the same sense of precession as the Branch A
debris around 80◦ \< Lambda \< 100◦, i.e. the stream angular momentum
vector moves in the direction of increasing l and decreasing b."*

NOTE: this poles are based solely on the density distribution, no
kinematics. The poles of the bright and faint branches are different and
change differently with Lambda.

*"Finally, the poles of the debris planes at the positions of the
apocentres seem to lie very close to each other, as judged by the Branch
A red contours in the left-hand panel and dark blue and light blue dots
(for the bright arm) in the right-hand panel, and reassuringly close to
the pole of 275◦, −14◦ chosen for orbit mapping in Section 4.1"*

*"The complex behaviour of the precession of the plane of the Sgr debris
that we have measured is most likely caused by an interplay between the
rotational kinematics (internal rotation) of the stripped material and
the torques exerted by the triaxial gravity field."*

### Pila-Díez et al. 2014:

We use data from two CFHT-MegaCam photometric pencil-beam surveys in the
g\' and the r\' bands to measure distances to the Sagittarius, the
Palomar 5 and the Orphan stream. We show that, using a cross-correlation
algorithm to detect the turnoff point of the main sequence, it is
possible to overcome the main limitation of a two-bands pencil-beam
survey, namely the lack of adjacent control-fields that can be used to
subtract the foreground and background stars to enhance the signal on
the colour-magnitude diagrams. We describe the cross-correlation
algorithm and its implementation. We combine the resulting main sequence
turnoff points with theoretical isochrones to derive photometric
distances to the streams. Our results (31 detections on the Sagittarius
stream and one each for the Palomar 5 and the Orphan streams) confirm
the findings by previous studies, **expand the distance trend for the
Sagittarius faint southern branch and trace the Sagittarius faint branch
of the northern-leading arm out to 56 kpc.** In addition, they show
evidence for nearby substructures. **We argue that these detections
trace the continuation of the Sagittarius northern-leading arm into the
southern hemisphere, and the northern wrap of the Sagittarius trailing
arm.** We provide accurate distance measurements to these detections.

**NOTE: they report the presence of the faint branch in the trailing
down to Lambda\~-50deg!** Already hinted at, with low significance, in
Pan-STARRS1 (Slater+13). They seem to confirm the presence of the second
wrap of the trailing in the north (after crossing the leading), first
hinted by Correnti+10. It also looks like they detect the second wrap of
the leading in the north, at D\~20kpc.

### Casey (PhD) 2014:

Low-resolution spectra for hundreds of stars in the direction of the
Virgo Over-Density and the Sagittarius northern leading arms have been
obtained. Multiple significant kinematic groups are recovered in this
accretion-dominated region, confirming detections by previous studies. A
metal-poor population (\[Fe/H\] = -1.7) in the Sagittarius stream is
discovered due to a photometric selection that was inadvertently biased
towards more metal-poor stars. Positions and kinematics of Sagittarius
stream members are compared with existing best-fitting dark matter
models, and a triaxial dark matter halo distribution is favoured.

Weisz et al. 2014: (follow up on Dolphin 2002)

*"We have excluded Sagittarius from this comparison due to its unusual
interaction history."*

NOTE: they don't comment on Sgr but they provide a cumulative SFH,
perhaps not too realistic.

### de Boer et al. 2014:

We employ abundances from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the
Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) to
study the α-element distribution of the stellar members of the
Sagittarius stream. To test the reliability of SDSS/SEGUE abundances for
the study of Sagittarius, we select high-likelihood samples tracing the
different components of the Milky Way, and recover known literature
α-element distributions. Using selection criteria based on the spatial
position, radial velocity, distance and colours of individual stars, we
obtain a robust sample of Sagittarius-stream stars. The α-element
distribution of the Sagittarius stream forms a narrow sequence at
intermediate metallicities with a clear turn-down, consistent with the
presence of an α-element \`knee\'. **This is the first time that the
α-element knee of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy has been detected.
Fitting a toy model to our data, we determine that the α-knee in
Sagittarius takes place at \[Fe/H\]=-1.27±0.05, only slightly less
metal-poor than the knee in the Milky Way.** This indicates that a small
number of Sagittarius-like galaxies could have contributed significantly
to the build-up of the Milky Way\'s stellar halo system at ancient
times.

*"Comparison to the age--metallicity relation from Forbes & Bridges
(2010) shows that the knee corresponds to an age of ≈11 Gyr, roughly 1.5
Gyr after their proposed start of star formation in Sgr. This time delay
between the onset of SN Ia is consistent with theories of galaxy
formation, which place the occurrence of the knee approximately 1 Gyr
after the start of star formation (see, e.g. Raiteri, Villata & Navarro
1996; Matteucci & Recchi 2001)."*

NOTE: their fitted alfa vs iron trends do not match current data, as it
lands right on top of the MW field stars (or even above if only
considering SDSS abundances). This puts a bit into question their
measured knee.

### Torrealba et al. 2015:

**Most prominent among these is a southern extension of the Sagittarius
dwarf galaxy\'s stream system, reaching down to declinations ∼ -40 °.**

NOTE: basically, they detect Sgr whole stream (first wrap) using RR
Lyrae.

### Koposov et al. 2015:

We show that a combination of infrared photometry from WISE and 2MASS
surveys can yield highly pure samples of M giant stars. We take
advantage of the new WISE∩2MASS M giant selection to trace the
Sagittarius (Sgr) trailing tail behind the Galactic disc in the
direction of the anticentre. The M giant candidates selected via
broad-band photometry are confirmed spectroscopically using AAOmega on
the Anglo-Australian Telescope in three fields around the extremity of
the Sgr trailing tail in the Southern Galactic hemisphere. **We
demonstrate that at the Sgr longitude tilde{Λ }\_{{⊙}} = 204°, the
line-of-sight velocities of the trailing tail starts to deviate from the
track of the Law & Majewski model, confirming the prediction of
Belokurov et al.** This discovery serves to substantiate the measurement
of low differential orbital precession of the Sgr stream which in turn
may imply diminished dark matter content within 100 kpc.

NOTE: they detect the stream "very" close to the stream (comparable to
Antoja+20 or Ramos+20). They have very few radial velocities, with a lot
of dispersion, but it is true that there is a slight disagreement with
LM10 (except for one point).

### Sohn et al. 2015:

We present a multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) study of stellar
proper motions (PMs) for four fields spanning 200° along the Sagittarius
(Sgr) stream: one trailing arm field, one field near the Sgr dwarf
spheroidal tidal radius, and two leading arm fields. We determine
absolute PMs of dozens of individual stars per field, using established
techniques that use distant background galaxies as the stationary
reference frame. Stream stars are identified based on combined
color-magnitude diagram and PM information. The results are broadly
consistent with the few existing PM measurements for the Sgr galaxy and
the trailing arm. However, **our new results provide the highest PM
accuracy for the stream to date, the first PM measurements for the
leading arm, and the first PM measurements for individual stream
stars**; we also serendipitously determine the PM of the globular
cluster NGC 6652. In the trailing-arm field, **the individual PMs allow
us to kinematically separate trailing-arm stars from leading-arm stars
that are 360° further ahead in their orbit.** Also, in three of our
fields **we find indications that two distinct kinematical components
may exist within the same arm and wrap of the stream**. Qualitative
comparison of the HST data to the predictions of the Law & Majewski and
Peñarrubia et al. N-body models show that the PM measurements closely
follow the predicted trend with Sgr longitude. This provides a
successful consistency check on the PM measurements, as well as on these
N-body approaches (which were not tailored to fit any PM data).

### Navarrete et al. 2017

We take advantage of the deep and wide coverage of the VLT Survey
Telescope (VST) ATLAS survey to study the line-of-sight structure of the
Sagittarius (Sgr) stellar stream in the Southern hemisphere, only ∼40°
away from the progenitor. We use photometrically selected subgiant
branch (SGB) stars to reveal a complex debris morphology of the trailing
arm and detect at least two clear peaks in the SGB distance modulus
distribution. The separation between the two line-of-sight components is
at least 5 kpc at the edge of the VST ATLAS footprint, but appears to
change along the stream, which allows us to conclude that these
detections correspond to two physically independent stellar structures,
rather than a mix of co-distant stellar populations within a single
stream. Our discovery of a fork in the Sgr trailing arm is verified
using blue horizontal branch stars, and our distance measurements are
calibrated using RR Lyrae stars from the Catalina Real-Time Transient
Survey. Comparing with numerical simulations of the Sgr dwarf
disruption, the more distant of the two components in the fork matches
perfectly with the track of the trailing debris. However, no obvious
counterpart exists in the simulation for the closer line-of-sight
component.

*"\[..\] fainter component of the Sgr bifurcation does not appear to be
traced by M-giants at all, which could be due to the metallicity
differences between the two branches as explained in Koposov et al.
(2012)."*

*"As the Sun is located very close to the plane of the Sgr stream, the
information on the shape of the tidal tails and thus the orbit of the
progenitor is encoded in the run of the line-of-sight distances along
the stream. Therefore, high distance accuracy is required to facilitate
an unbiased gravitational potential inference. \[..\] Moreover, good
distance precision is necessary to unpick multiple wraps of the stream
in a given direction. For example, Belokurov et al. (2006) detected
multiple debris components along the sightlines towards the leading tail
using SGB stars as tracers. It is likely that the so-called branch C of
the stream they see behind the leading debris is in fact a part of the
trailing tail. Correnti et al. (2010) used RC stars to produce further
evidence for multiple wraps of the stream."*

*"\[We\] show that (i) the trailing tail bifurcation detected by Koposov
et al. (2012) continues into the VST ATLAS footprint and (ii) the
trailing debris appears to be split along the line of sight, with the
additional stream component following a distinct distance track."*

*"VST ATLAS covers two big patches of the sky at negative declinations,
centred at (α, δ) = (195.◦0, --24.◦5) and (10.◦0, --11.◦0). \[..\] the
VST ATLAS covers mostly the region with B \< 0◦. Thus, the focus of this
study is mostly on the bright branch of the trailing Sgr tail."*

*"it is immediately apparent that the SGB portion of the Hess diagram of
the trailing tail in the ATLAS data is much broader than the SGB of the
leading tail in the SDSS. In fact, there is a striking resemblance of
the behaviour of the SGB considered here and the split SGB shown in the
left-hand panel of fig. 4 of Belokurov et al. (2006). In the north, the
double SGB arises due to the projection along the line of sight of the
two independent Sgr streams, the socalled **branches A and C. We
conjecture that a similar situation is observed in this portion of the
trailing tail in the south.** \[..\] Intriguingly, this \[faint\] branch
of the stream -- studied earlier by Koposov et al. (2012) and Slater et
al. (2013) -- also does not possess a particularly tight SGB, thus
hinting at multiple debris along the line of sight in the direction of
the faint trailing Sgr branch."*

NOTE: C branch is actually the trailing tail intersecting the leading
arm at Lambda\~90deg. See also Correnti+2010.

*"The presence of two peaks in the SGB LF of the bright Sgr stream (i.e.
B˜ \< 0◦), separated by about 0.6 mag, could be either due to two
distinct Sgr tidal debris overdensities at two different distances along
the line of sight or, alternatively, due to a complex stellar population
in the Sgr stream, albeit all at the same distance."*

NOTE: from figure 5, right panel, it is easy to see that the bright
branch (but also the faint) are crossed by the leading tail at
Lambda\~70deg, close to the predicted Lambdas (V21 model). For the Faint
branch (fig. 6), the signal seems to be dominated by the leading debris
at Lambda>-50deg, at least in SGB stars. They still produce two peaks in
the Luminosity Function even at Lambda\~-40deg, but I do not see that in
Fig.6.

*"\[in the the faint branch and with BHB\] stream 1 appears to break up
into further two substructures, again in agreement with the complex
signal in the SGB residuals map presented above."*

"*Overall, the BHB stars fully corroborate the picture established
earlier with the SGB tracers: the trailing debris appears to be
bifurcated into two components along the line of sight. However, the
bright Sgr trailing arm detections appear to be much more significant
compared to the ones found at the faint arm. Note, however, that without
kinematic information it is impossible to establish with 100 per cent
certainty that the brighter BHBs have indeed originated from the Sgr
dwarf. Perhaps, these could belong to a different halo substructure,
unrelated to Sgr. To clarify further the nature of the BHB stars with
lower m − M, their position on the sky is studied in Section 4.3."*

*"From the 327 RRL stars originally identified in the Sgr 1 overdensity,
we selected only those confined to the plane of the bright trailing arm
of Sgr, i.e. between −7◦ \< B˜ \< 0◦. This spatial selection reduces the
sample size to 250 RRL, spanning the longitude of the Sgr stream from ˜
= −50◦ to ˜ = −6◦. Unfortunately, because of the spatial limits of the
survey, there are only 42 RRL located at positive B˜ , thus making it
unfeasible to track down the peaks for the faint Sgr branch. Therefore,
the RRL distribution is only analysed here for the bright branch of the
Sgr trailing arm."*

NOTE: Hernitschek+17 ran into the same problem, and could not detect the
faint branch significantly in the trailing arm.

*"We detect two peaks in the heliocentric distance distribution of RRL
in Sgr 1 in the first two bins, namely at ˜ ∼ −40◦ and ˜ ∼ −33◦. In the
two bins closest to the progenitor, the distance distribution of RRL is
consistent with one broad peak that was modelled with a single
Gaussian."*

*"Curiously, the two components \[of the bright branch\] diverge at the
point where the young trailing debris cross the wrap of the leading
tail. This, however, might be a pure coincidence given that the
simulated leading tail appears to be moving almost perpendicular to the
SGB 2. \[..\] The other two SGB detections \[of the faint branch\] do
not appear in the distribution of the simulated debris. However, again,
around the location studied here, there appears to be a large spray of
the leading debris."*

NOTE: based on Fig.11 it is clear that they are detecting the leading
arm, which is correlated with Beta. At Beta>0, it is easier to detect at
farther distances. At Beta\<0, it dominates at closer distances. In any
case, the faint branch in the trailing arm runs parallel to the bright
branch.

NOTE: they don't detect any metallicity differences between the RRLyrae
in the two streams, but that is expected in any case because there is no
gradient in metallicity for the RR Lyrae.

### Tepper-Garcia et al. 2018:

The remarkable 1994 discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr)
revealed that, together with the Magellanic Clouds, there are at least
three major dwarf galaxies, each with a total mass of order
10\^10-10\^11 M⊙, falling onto the Galaxy in the present epoch. Beyond a
Galactic radius of 300 kpc, dwarfs tend to retain their gas. At roughly
50 kpc, the Magellanic Clouds have experienced substantial gas stripping
as evidenced by the Magellanic Stream which extends from them. **Since
Sgr experienced star formation long after it fell into the Galaxy, it is
interesting to explore just how and when this dwarf lost its gas.** To
date, there has been no definitive detection of an associated gas
component. We revisit recent simulations of the stellar and dark matter
components of Sgr but, for the first time, include gas that is initially
bound to the infalling galaxy. **We find that the gas stripping was
30-50 per cent complete at its first disc crossing ∼2.7 Gyr ago, then
entirely stripped at its last disc crossing ∼1 Gyr ago.** **Our timeline
is consistent with the last substantial burst of star formation in Sgr,
which occurred about the time of the last disc crossing.** We discuss
the consequences of gas stripping and conclude that the vast majority of
the stripped gas was fully settled onto the Galaxy by ∼300 Myr ago. It
is highly unlikely that any of the high- or intermediate-velocity clouds
have a direct association with the Sgr dwarf.

*"Did the interaction with the Galaxy induce star-forming episodes in
Sgr? It is believed that pericentric passages are associated with bursts
of star formation (e.g. Mayer et al. 2001). Siegel et al. (2007)
identify at least two distinct stellar populations in Sgr, with ages
∼2.3 and ∼0.1−0.8 Gyr. In our model, Sgr experiences pericentric
passages at ∼2.8 and ∼1.3 Gyr, which would be consistent with delayed
star formation episodes at the epochs determined from observations.
Moreover, pericentric passages are closely related to disc transits
that, as our results show, remove a significant fraction of the gas
within a dwarf system. Thus, our model suggests that the last
pericentric passage of Sgr about the Galaxy triggered the last burst of
star formation within the dwarf prior to its disc crossing, just before
the dwarf was fully stripped of its remaining gas."*

*"Was the Sgr precursor a disc galaxy? Łokas et al. (2010) speculate
that the observed geometric and kinematic structure of Sgr's stellar
remnant cannot be recovered unless the precursor had a disc. But is has
been argued that a residual kinematic signature should be observable in
Sgr stellar remnant if it had been a disc galaxy (Penarrubia et al. ˜
2010), which does not appear to be the case (Penarrubia et al. ˜ 2011).
Our results show that Sgr's present-day morphology can be recovered from
a gas-bearing, spheroidal progenitor. But we cannot make any statement
about its kinematics. Yet, **we argue that Sgr need not have had a
significant disc component prior to infall, and could even have been a
gas-rich dwarf spheroidal, which has been observed (Blitz & Robishaw
2000)."***

"*Is the gas stripped away from Sgr currently observable as high- or
intermediate-velocity gas? Under the assumption that stellar feedback
within the dwarf does not play an important role in removing gas, we
argued that the mass of the stripped gas around the Galaxy as given by
our model may be regarded as an upper limit at any given time. And even
more so since we ignore the onset of starburst- or nuclear-driven winds
within the Galaxy which impact negatively the lifetime of gas clouds
(e.g. Cooper et al. 2009). In other words, our model favours the
survivability within the Galactic halo of the gas stripped away from
Sgr. Given the resulting lack of gas associated with Sgr in the halo in
our model, we conclude that it is unlikely that any of the gas stripped
away from Sgr survived to be observable as HVCs or IVCs, as has been
claimed in the past (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 1998; Putman et al. 2004).*"

### Hasselquist et al. 2021:

APOGEE chemical analysis of several dwarfs in the MW.

Sgr: "*To select Sgr members, we take a similar approach to that of
Hayes et al. (2020). We first only consider stars with \[Fe/H\] \< 0.0,
heliocentric distance greater than 10 kpc, and within ±30◦ of the plane
of the Sgr stream (Majewski et al. 2003). Then, we make an initial
selection in Vzs - Lzs plane, where Vzs and Lzs are the vertical
velocity and angular momenta in the Sagittarius Galactocentric
coordinate system, as derived and described in Majewski et al. (2003).
We then make further selections in the φvel,s-Λs plane, where φvel,s is
the velocity direction in the X and Y directions of the Sgr coordinate
system and Λs is the longitude along the Sgr stream (Majewski et al.
2003; Hayes et al. 2020), to remove stars that are moving perpendicular
to the stream. \[..\] we are primarily analyzing the abundance patterns
of luminous giants (log(g) \< 1.5)."*

*"Compared to the other dwarf galaxies (Figure 7), only Sgr extends to
as high metallicities as the LMC. However, the metal-poor LMC stars have
lower \[α/Fe\] (by ∼ 0.05- 0.1 dex) than the Sgr stars until \[Fe/H\] =
-1.0, at which point the LMC increases its \[α/Fe\] abundance, whereas*

*the \[α/Fe\]-\[Fe/H\] abundance track of Sgr continues to decrease
before becoming mostly flat. \[..\] As shown in Figure 7, only Sgr
appears to show a similar increase in \[(C+N)/Fe\] as the LMC at
\[Fe/H\] \> -0.7, although this increase is not as steep as the increase
in the LMC. \[..\] The \[Ni/Mg\] of the metal-rich LMC is slightly
deficient as compared to the metal-rich Sgr stars, with the LMC stars
lying in between the two MW sequences, and Sgr lying closer to the MW
low-α sequence. \[..\] Such a change in slope is less evident in the
\[Ce/Mg\]-\[Mg/H\] abundance patterns of Sgr, which has a flat \[Mg/Fe\]
trend at high metallicity. "*

*"\[O/Mg\] and \[Si/Mg\] for the LMC, and other dwarf galaxies, slowly
decrease (by about 0.1 dex) over the range -1.3 \< \[Mg/H\] \< -0.5,
with both the LMC and Sgr joining the MW trends at \[Mg/H\] \> -0.5.
This is either a result of metallicity-dependent Type II SNe yields for
these elements (e.g., more Si and O relative to the MW at low
metallicity), or a result of a slowly increasing Type II/Type Ia SNe
fraction, as star formation was extended after the initial SF epoch. The
\[Fe/Mg\] suggests the latter scenario is plausible, at least from -0.8
\< \[Mg/H\] \< -0.4, over which the \[Fe/Mg\] ratio slowly decreases as
more Type II SNe contribute. The slightly enhanced \[Ca/Mg\] for the LMC
and Sgr at these metallicities as compared to the MW stars is a result
of Type Ia contribution to Ca, which is still substantial even with the
starburst injecting many more Type II SNe products than at lower
metallicities. These results suggest that Ca has a higher contribution
from Type Ia SNe than Si (also see e.g., Tsujimoto et al. 1995; Hayes et
al. 2018)."*

***"The chemistry of the Sgr dwarf has been studied by numerous authors
(e.g., Chou et al. 2007; Sbordone et al. 2007; McWilliam et al. 2013;
Hasselquist et al. 2017; Carlin et al. 2018; Hansen et al. 2018), with
Hayes et al. (2020) analyzing the largest sample of core and stream
stars using APOGEE DR16. In general, these analyses all find the
\[X/Fe\] abundances of the more metal-rich stars in the Sgr core to be
below the MW abundance trends. Interpretations of such sub-solar
abundance ratios range from high Type Ia/Type II SNe ratio to toplight
IMF. Here we analyze a sample of stars that is essentially an expanded
sample of Hayes et al. (2020). While a detailed analysis of the spatial
dependence of the chemical abundance patterns of Sgr is beyond the***

***scope of this work, we find that the Sgr stream sample is ∼ 0.5 dex
more metal-poor than the main body sample (see e.g., Hayes et al. 2020).
However, we verify that stars***

***with similar metallicities between the two samples have
near-identical chemical abundance patterns (see §A.3 for more details).
The α-elements in Sgr smoothly decline from -2.5 \< \[Fe/H\] \< -0.9,
going from the MW "halo" high-α plateau at the metal-poor end to below
the MW low-α "thin" disk trend at \[Fe/H\] = -0.9. Sgr begins this
decline at a slightly higher metallicity than the MCs, but a lower
metallicity than GSE. At \[Fe/H\] \> -0.9, the \[O/Fe\], \[Si/Fe\] and
\[Ca/Fe\] abundances are nearly flat at solar***

***or slightly sub-solar values, but the \[Mg/Fe\] abundance shows a
slight increase followed by a decrease, as also observed in the SMC. The
\[α/Fe\] abundance of Sgr at***

***\[Fe/H\] \> -0.9 remains ∼ 0.1 dex below the LMC trend and MW low-α
sequence. While Sgr extends to slightly higher values of \[Fe/H\] than
the LMC, both galaxies enriched to nearly the same level of \[Mg/H\],
with the Sgr abundance trend being deficient in \[Fe/Mg\] as compared to
the MCs at \[Fe/H\] \> -1.0, but enhanced at \[Fe/H\] \> -1.0. The Sgr
stars with \[Mg/H\] \> -0.5 are very slightly enhanced in \[Ca/Mg\] as
compared to the LMC, but otherwise the \[Ca/Mg\], \[O/Mg\], and
\[Si/Mg\] patterns are nearly identical to those of the LMC."***

***"The α-element abundance patterns show that early on in its
evolution, Sgr experienced relatively weak star formation as compared to
the MW and GSE, but stronger than the MCs and Fnx. Sgr then evolved to a
much higher Type Ia/Type II SNe ratio than the other dwarf galaxies,
with a \[Fe/Mg\] ratio that is enhanced over the MCs and MW low-α
sequence at \[Mg/H\] \> -1.0. Despite this clear difference in early
star formation efficiency, Sgr and LMC enrich to nearly the same levels
of \[Fe/H\], with Sgr extending to metallicities that are ∼ 0.2 dex
higher than the LMC. The increased early SFE and enhanced enrichment is
unexpected in the paradigm of the mass-metallicity relationship (Kirby
et al. 2011), as the Sgr dwarf was thought to be much less massive***

***than the LMC. However, the two galaxies do enrich to the same level
of \[Mg/H\], implying the tension is somewhat reduced if \[Mg/H\] is
used to track metallicity instead of \[Fe/H\]. To more accurately
analyze where these two galaxies lie on the mass-metallicity
relationship, we would need to better account for selection biases,
which is beyond the scope of this work. Both the final metallicity and
the early SFE seem to show Sgr behaving as though it were a fairly
massive dwarf galaxy. The flat, or near-flat, in the case of Mg,
\[α/Fe\]-\[Fe/H\] abundance patterns at \[Fe/H\] \> -0.9 imply that Sgr
did experience some extended SF, with an increase in Mg from Type II SNe
preventing the \[Fe/Mg\] abundance from rising further. This extended
star formation event could have been started as Sgr began falling into
the MW. As shown in Hayes et al. (2020), the Sgr stream does not contain
stars with \[Fe/H\] & -0.50, but the Sgr \[α/Fe\] abundance becomes flat
with increasing \[Fe/H\] at \[Fe/H\] ∼ -0.9. So the extended star
formation occurred before some stars were stripped as well as after,
plausibly corresponding with pericenter passages through the disk of the
MW (see also Ruiz-Lara et al. 2020a)."***

***"As described in §5.3, the relatively flat α-element abundance
patterns at \[Fe/H\] \> -0.8 suggest some kind of extended SFH. Both
models find that a second star formation epoch, beginning some 5-6 Gyr
into its evolution and rising above the declining trend from earlier
times, is required in Sgr to produce the flatter or "hooked" abundance
α-element abundance pattern. Without such a secondary peak, the chemical
evolution tracks show monotonically decreasing \[Si/Fe\] or \[Mg/Fe\]
with increasing \[Fe/H\], rather than the slight flattening of the
observations. In the flexCE model, the sharp minimum of star formation
at 5 Gyr produces the kink in the \[Si/Fe\]-\[Fe/H\] abundance track,
slightly improving the fit to the data. In both models, this second SF
epoch is not as***

***strong relative to the earlier epoch, in contrast to the MCs, and as
such, the \[α/Fe\] ratio is not enhanced like it is in the MCs. The
early chemical enrichment of Sgr was in between GSE and the MCs in both
models (e.g., intermediate SFE), with Sgr enriching to \[Fe/H\] = -0.7
and -1.0 5 Gyr into its evolution for the flexCE model and the Lian
model, respectively. After this point, the flexCE model favor a shorter,
stronger burst, compared to a more sustained, weaker burst for the Lian
model. In both models, Sgr effectively stops forming stars 10 Gyr into
its evolution, which is consistent with observations of Sgr that show
few or no young*** ***(age \< 2-3 Gyr) stars (e.g., Siegel et al. 2007),
as well as the \[C/N\] inferences shown in §4.6."***

"The Sgr comparison is shown in the bottom-right panel of Figure 12.
Neither model matches well with the Weisz et al. (2014) SFH of Sgr,
though they agree well with each other. This could be due to the fact
that our Sgr sample contains many stream stars, whereas Weisz et al.
(2014) was looking at the main body of the galaxy, where the tidal
interactions have preferentially removed many metal-poor stars,
including into the streams. However, all of the star formation histories
agree that Sgr formed nearly all of its stars by 3-4 Gyr ago. This is
mostly in line with other photometric SFH studies, such as Siegel et al.
(2007), although we do not find the metal-rich youngest populations that
they find in the core. de Boer et al. (2015) find that the Sgr stream
stars exhibit a tight age-metallicity relation, enriching to \[Fe/H\] =
-0.7 by 5-7 Gyr ago, again consistent with both model results (see the
bottom row of Figures 9 and 10). Our SFH here also qualitatively agrees
with recent work by Garro et al. (2021), who analyzed the ages and
metallicities of the globular cluster population of Sgr, including 12
new clusters discovered by Minniti et al. (2021). They find that Sgr
formed its metal-rich (-0.9 \< \[Fe/H\] \< -0.3) globular clusters some
6-8 Gyr ago."

## Notes

### Velázquez and White 1995

*"We use numerical simulations to test the feasibility of the suggestion
by Ibata, Gilmore & Irwin that the excess population of stars which they
discovered in the Sagittarius region may be the disrupted remains of a
dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We find that a Fornax-like model for the
pre-disruption system can indeed reproduce the data. However, the galaxy
must be on a relatively short-period orbit with a pericentre of about 10
kpc and an apocentre of about 52 kpc, giving a current transverse
velocity of 255 km/s and a period of \~ 760 Myr. Furthermore, disruption
must have occurred predominantly on the last pericentric passage rather
than on the present one. The data are consistent with transverse motion
either towards or away from the Galactic plane. These results depend
primarily on the rotation curve of the Galaxy and are insensitive to the
mass distribution in its outer halo or to the mass of its disc."*

*" (iv) this orbit has a period of about 760 Myr so that Sagittarius
completed more than 10 orbits before it was finally disrupted;"*

### Edelsohn, D. J.; Elmegreen, B. G. 1997:

The interaction between the dwarf galaxy in Sagittarius and the Milky
Way Galaxy has been modelled with a parallel computer implementation of
an N-body treecode. Models are made that reproduce the observed
position, size, velocity, proper motion and velocity gradient of the
dwarf in its likely pre-disc encounter, and other models are studied in
which the dwarf has just passed through the disc. Several observable
differences between these cases are found. In the pre-collision case,
the dwarf is bound to the Milky Way and it passed through the disc
previously 1.7 x 108 yr ago in the anticentre direction. It will cross
through the disc again in 3.5 x 107 yr. **Each disc crossing spins up
the dwarf core and tidally stretches its outer envelope, leaving the
core slightly less bound.** If such disc crossings are common for dwarfs
near large galaxies, then the likely removal of gas from the dwarf at
each crossing, combined with the observed high dark matter fraction for
most dwarfs, implies that dark matter is not in the form of undetected
cold gas. In the preferred model, the outer envelope of the dwarf
includes the positions and velocities of the globular clusters NGC 6715,
Terzan 7, Terzan 8 and Arp 2, which implies that these clusters could be
fragments of a previously larger system. They could also be old detached
star formation cores that formed in the Sagittarius dwarf during
previous disc crossings.

NOTE: in this paper, they just drop a bound system into the MW. No time
to create a stream or anything. Very simplistic set-up.

### Ibata+97:

"*Apparently the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal, and by implication other
dSph galaxies, do not have a centrally-concentrated profile for their
dark matter. We develop a model in which the stars of the Sgr dwarf are
embedded in a constant-density dark matter halo, representing the core
of a tidally-limited system, and show that this is consistent with its
survival.*"

"*Three-Dimensional Shape. The red clump stars provide the most robust
estimate of the line-of-sight depth, and from above the half-brightness
depth is 1.2 kpc. This is remarkably similar to the minor axis
parameters derived from the isopleth maps of Sec. 2.7, where the
half-brightness minor axis diameter, for a distance of 25 kpc, is 2X550
pc. The three-dimensional shape of the Sgr dwarf is thus a prolate
spheroid with axis ratios 3:1:1 and a long axis approximately in the
plane of the sky and at constant longitude.*"

**We get a depth of 1.65 kpc (dispersion at a distance of \~27kpc), a
height of 1.65º -\> (disp in B at dist of 27kpc) \~2x0.4 kpc = 0.8kpc
and a length of \~5º -\> (disp of L at d=27kpc) \~2x1.2 = 2.4 kpc. Thus
the ratio we get is \~3:2:1 (very rough numbers).**

### Ibata & Lewis1998:

Are dwarf spheroidal galaxies dark matter dominated? We present N-body
simulations of the interaction between the Milky Way and its closest
companion, the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, constrained by new
kinematic, distance and surface density observations detailed in a
companion paper. It is shown that there is no possible self-consistent
solution to the present existence of the Sagittarius dwarf if its
distribution of luminous matter traces the underlying distribution of
mass. The luminous component of the dwarf galaxy must therefore be
shielded within a small dark matter halo. Though at present we are
unable to construct a fully self-consistent model that includes both the
stellar and dark matter components, it is shown numerically that it is
possible that a pure dark matter model, approximating the dark matter
halo deduced for the Sagittarius dwarf from analytical arguments, may
indeed survive the Galactic tides.

The orbit of the Sagittarius dwarf around the Milky Way is considered,
taking into account the perturbative effects of the Magellanic Clouds.
It is shown that at the present time, the orbital period must be short,
∼ 0.7 Gyr; the initial orbital period for a 109 M⊙ model will have been
∼ 1 Gyr. It is found that a close encounter with the Magellanic Clouds
may have occurred, though the chances of such an interaction affecting
the orbit of the Sagittarius dwarf is negligible.

*"The effect of dynamical friction on the galaxy models we consider is
significant, but not overwhelming. \[..\] The mean Galactocentric
distance (averaged over an orbit) of the Sagittarius dwarf is \>∼ 25
kpc, while the most massive models considered below have M∼10\^9 M⊙;
with these assumptions Tfric \> 10 Gyr, so that such a model could have
reduced its initial mean orbital radius by at most a factor of 2. Since
Tfric is prop. to M\^−1, models with M ∼ 10\^8 M⊙ will hardly be
affected at all."*

"The present concentration of the stellar population in the Sagittarius
dwarf is c ∼ 0.5 (IWGIS). The initial stellar concentration is, of
course, unknown but may be estimated by comparison to other ellipsoidal
galaxies. Of the Milky Way dSphs, the most concentrated is Sculptor,
with c = 1.12 (Irwin & Hatzidimitriou 1995). As a firm upper limit we
adopt a maximum initial concentration of c = 2.1 in our models. (The
value c = 2.1 corresponds to a central value of (Ψ/σ\^2)0 = 9 in the
formalism of Binney & Tremaine 1987, which we follow below, where Ψ is
the relative potential and σ is a model parameter related, but not
equivalent, to the central velocity dispersion). This choice is
conservative, since only dynamically very evolved stellar systems have
significantly higher concentration."

"It was observed that the models never evolved to a state with a higher
central velocity dispersion; we therefore investigated models with
velocity dispersion equal to, or higher than the observed present
velocity dispersion of the dwarf."

### Zhao 1998:

How has the "fluffy" core of the Sgr dwarf galaxy survived multiple
strong shocks from the tidal force of the Galactic halo and disc since
the formation of the core a Hubble time ago? A scenario that Sgr was
deflected to its current orbit by the Magellanic Clouds after a
rendezvous on the north Galactic pole 2 − 3 Gyrs ago is examined. **It
is shown that the conditions of the collision fix both the sense of
circulation of Sgr and the LMC around the Galaxy and the slope of the
Galactic rotation curve.** The model argues that the two orthogonal
polar circles traced by a dozen or so Galactic halo dwarf galaxies and
globular clusters (LMC-SMC-Magellanic Stream-Draco-Ursa Minor along l ≈
270o and M54-Ter 7-Ter 8-Arp 2-NGC 2419-Pal 15 along l ≈ 0 o) are
streams of tidal relics from two ancient galaxies which was captured on
two intersecting polar rosette orbits by the Galaxy. Our results favor
the interpretation of microlensing towards the LMC being due to source
or lens stars in tidal features of the Magellanic Clouds. We discuss
direct and indirect observations to test the collision scenario.

They used the MCs to pose the following: Sgr doesn't need a big core of
DM protecting it. Instead, it lived at a large Lz/Energy orbit until the
MCs kicked it inwards and the disruption really started. That in turn
poses, based on the timing of this encounter, constraints on the mass
distribution of the MW. This requires both LMC and Sgr to have been
around for a very long time, since this encounter had to happen some
2--3 Gyr ago. This scenario seems unlikely today but it could be
interesting to consider a more prolonged interaction Sgr-LMC.

### Ibata et al. 1998:

Hydrodynamical calculations undertaken to simulate the collisional
interaction between the Sagittarius dwarf and the Galactic outer HI disk
are presented, constrained by recently derived orbital and mass
parameters for this dwarf galaxy. It is found that a significant
distortion to the structure of the Galactic HI disk will be induced by
the collision if the mass of the dwarf exceeds ∼ 10\^9 M⊙; this value is
consistent with an estimate derived by requiring

that the dwarf galaxy is sufficiently robust to survive tidal disruption
until the present time. Though the precise details of the interaction
are compromised in our simulations by the lack of a live Galactic halo,
we find that for model masses \>∼ 5 × 10\^9 M⊙, prominent spiral arms
and a substantial lopsidedness in the outer disk are produced.
Furthermore, a noticeable warp-like structure is induced in the disk.
Thus the Sagittarius dwarf may have significantly affected the star
formation history and structure of the outer Galaxy. These simulations
confirm the possibility of determining the current merging rate of low
surface brightness, gas-poor dwarf galaxies of mass \>∼ 10\^9M⊙ onto
giant spiral galaxies from careful analysis of observations of the
structure of HI disks.

### Gómez-Flechoso 1999:

The existence of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with high internal velocity
dispersions orbiting in the Milky Way raises questions about their dark
matter content and lifetime. In this paper, we present an alternative
solution to the dark matter dominated satellites proposed by Ibata &
Lewis (1998) for the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. We performed simulations
of two kinds of N-body satellites: the first models (f-models) could
correspond to satellites with high dark matter content and they
represent initially isolated models. The second models (smodels) have
either low or negligible dark matter content and they are constructed in
a tidal field. In spite of being on the same orbits, the s-models are
able to produce a better agreement with some observational constraints
concerning Sagittarius. From our simulations, we can also infer that
Sagittarius is in the process of being disrupted.

### 

### **Johnston et al. 1999**

We present a comparison of semianalytic models of the phase-space
structure of tidal debris with measurements of average distances,
velocities, and surface densities of stars associated with the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, compiled from all observations reported since
its discovery in 1994. We find that several interesting features in the
data can be explained by these models. The properties of stars about
+/-10 deg-15 deg away from the center of Sgr-in particular, the
orientation of material perpendicular to Sgr\'s orbit and the kink in
the velocity gradient-are consistent with those expected for unbound
material stripped during the most recent pericentric passage \~50 Myr
ago. The break in the slope of the surface density seen by Mateo,
Olszewski, & Morrison at b\~-35 deg can be understood as marking the end
of this material. However, the detections beyond this point are unlikely
to represent debris in a trailing streamer, torn from Sgr during the
immediately preceding passage \~0.7 Gyr ago, as the surface density of
this streamer would be too low compared with observations in these
regions. The low-b detections are more plausibly explained by a leading
streamer of material that was lost more that 1 Gyr ago and has wrapped
all the way around the Galaxy to intercept the line of sight. The
distance and velocity measurements at b=-40 deg reported by Majewski et
al. in a companion paper also support this hypothesis. We determine
debris models with these properties on orbits that are consistent with
the currently known positions and velocities of Sgr in Galactic
potentials with halo components that have circular velocities
v_circ=140-200 km s\^-1. In all cases, the orbits oscillate between \~12
and \~40 kpc from the Galactic center with radial time periods of
0.55-0.75 Gyr. **The best match to the data is obtained in models where
Sgr currently has a mass of \~10\^9 M_solar and has orbited the Galaxy
for at least the last 1 Gyr, during which time it has reduced its mass
by a factor of 2-3**, or luminosity by an amount equivalent to \~10% of
the total luminosity of the Galactic halo. These numbers suggest that
Sgr is rapidly disrupting and unlikely to survive beyond a few more
pericentric passages. These conclusions are only tentative, because they
rely heavily on the less certain measurements of debris properties far
from the center of Sgr. **However, they demonstrate the immense
potential for using debris to determine Sgr\'s dynamical history in
great detail.**

NOTES: first model to account for striped material, not only the core.
Interestingly, they discuss the different wrapps and how the transition
from 3p material to 2p material in the trailing arm (in terms of Ramos
et al. 2021) is seen as a break in the density as observed by Mateo et
al. 1998. **From the V21 model, we see that T3p1w is mainly centred
around b=-27deg, and that the transition to T2p1w happens more or less
at b=-35deg.** They then say that the rest of the material (Majewski et
al. 1999) at lower latitudes is the leading arm, which is not correct.

### Jiang, Ing-Guey and Binney, James 2000:

Possible orbital histories of the Sgr dwarf galaxy are explored. A
special-purpose N-body code is used to construct the first models of the
Milky Way-Sgr dwarf system in which both the Milky Way and the Sgr dwarf
are represented by full N-body systems and followed for a Hubble time.
These models are used to calibrate a semi-analytic model of the Sgr
dwarf\'s orbit that enables us to explore a wider parameter space than
is accessible to the N-body models. We conclude that the extant data on
the Sgr dwarf are compatible with a wide range of orbital histories. At
one extreme the Sgr dwarf initially possesses \~10\^11Msolar and starts
from a Galactocentric distance RD(0)>\~200kpc. At the other extreme the
Sgr dwarf starts with \~10\^9Msolar and RD(0)\~60kpc, similar to its
present apocentric distance. In all cases the Sgr dwarf is initially
dark matter dominated and the current velocity dispersion of the Sgr
dwarf\'s dark matter is tightly constrained to be 21+/-2kms-1. This
number is probably compatible with the smaller measured dispersion of
the Sgr dwarf\'s stars because of (i) the dynamical difference between
dark and luminous matter, and (ii) velocity anisotropy.

NOTES: Their stream doesn't look very realistic but they explore the
Dark Matter mass loss for different orbits. Nothing on the stellar side.

### Helmi and White 2001:

We present two simple dynamical models for Sagittarius based on N-body
simulations of the progressive disruption of a satellite galaxy orbiting
for 12.5Gyr within a realistic Galactic potential. In both models the
satellite initially has observable properties similar to those of
current outlying dwarfs; in one case it is purely stellar while in the
other it is embedded in an extended massive halo. The purely stellar
progenitor is a King model with a total velocity dispersion of
18.9kms-1, a core radius of 0.44kpc and a tidal radius of 3kpc. The
initial stellar distribution in the other case follows a King profile
with the same core radius, a slightly larger total velocity dispersion
and similar extent. Both these models are consistent with all published
data on the current Sagittarius system, they match not only the observed
properties of the main body of Sagittarius, but also those reported for
unbound debris at larger distances.

NOTES: their stream is not that good, but is not terrible either. Most
of their stars become unbound in the last 3 Gyr. I don't see how they
can claim a match with the data for a dwarf w/o DM since I97
demonstrated that such a system would not survive. Bit puzzled here.
Also, like all the other models up to this point, they assume Sgr was
always orbiting the MW. None consider it as an initially unbound dwarf.

NOTES! (from Majewski+03): *"From being able to identify two viable
structural models, Helmi & White conclude that a long-lived Sgr is not
'' in any way anomalous.'' However, it should be noted that their models
succeed by using a lighter Milky Way (asymptotic circular velocity for
the flat rotation curve of only 186 km s1 and mass interior to present
Sgr location*

*of 7:87 1010 M) and more benign Sgr orbit (larger, 70 kpc apocenter and
longer, 1 Gyr period) than typically used by previous models."*

### Bailin 2003:

Using recent determinations of the mass (0.4-2e9 Msun) and orbit of
Sagittarius, I calculate its orbital angular momentum. From the latest
observational data, I also calculate the angular momentum of the Milky
Way\'s warp. I find that both angular momenta are directed toward
l\~270deg, b=0deg and have magnitude (2-8)×1012 Msolar kpc km s-1, where
the range in both cases reflects uncertainty in the mass. The
coincidence of the angular momenta is suggestive of a coupling between
these systems. **Direct gravitational torque of Sgr on the disk is ruled
out as the coupling mechanism. Gravitational torque due to a wake in the
halo and the impulsive deposition of momentum by a passage of Sgr
through the disk are still both viable mechanisms** pending better
simulations to test their predictions on the observed Sagittarius-Milky
Way system.

*"Ibata & Razoumov (1998) performed simulations which suggest that the
passage of a sufficiently massive Sgr (5 × 109 M⊙) through the disk
could produce a warp. Alternatively, its gravitational tides or the
tides of a wake it produces in the dark halo could exert a warp-inducing
torque on the disk."*

*"There are three possibilities for the nature of the coupling. The
first is a direct gravitational tidal torque by the satellite itself
(Hunter & Toomre 1969), the second is the gravitational torque of a wake
in the Galactic dark matter halo (Weinberg 1998; Tsuchiya 2002), and the
third is an impulsive deposition of momentum to the gas disk by passage
through it (Ibata & Razoumov 1998). The direct tidal torque for a
satellite of mass m and distance r scales as m/r3. Therefore, the direct
tidal effect of Sgr is no stronger than that of the LMC, whose direct
tidal torque is not sufficient to induce the warp (Hunter & Toomre
1969). This means that the gravitational torque of Sgr itself cannot be
the coupling mechanism. If the primary perturber is instead a wake in
the halo, the strength of the torque scales as mwake/r3 wake. The mass
of the wake scales as the mass of the satellite and as the density of
the halo at the wake radius (Weinberg 1998). The wake develops at half
the satellite's orbital radius (Tsuchiya 2002). Therefore, for an
isothermal halo, the strength of the torque scales as m/r5. In this
case, the effect of Sagittarius is 10--50 times stronger than that of
the LMC. "*

### Law et al. 2004

N-body simulations are used to model the tidal disruption of the
Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy with constraints set by the positions and
velocities of M giants in the Sgr tidal arms recently revealed by the
Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). The simulated Sgr dwarf is placed on
a variety of orbits within a Milky Way potential parameterized by
variable circular velocities, halo flattenings and radial profiles. Two
hundred separate test particle orbits have been used to explore a wide
range of model Milky Way potentials and dwarf galaxy characteristics.
The family of models is delimited by the data to a relatively narrow
allowed range of parameters, and then input into N-body simulations. We
present our best-fitting model, and discuss the orbital period,
apoGalacticon distance, current space velocity, mass-to-light ratio, and
other characteristics of the Sgr dwarf. In addition, we discuss the
implications of this model for the flattening of the Galactic halo.

### Helmi 2004:

Recently, radial velocities have been measured for a large sample of M
giants from the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog, selected to be part
of the Sgr dwarf leading and trailing streams. Here we present a
comparison of their kinematics to models of the Sgr dwarf debris
orbiting Galactic potentials, with halo components of varying degrees of
flattening and elongation. This comparison shows that the portion of the
trailing stream mapped so far is dynamically young and hence does not
provide very stringent constraints on the shape of the Galactic dark
matter halo. The leading stream, however, contains slightly older
debris, and its kinematics provide for the first time direct evidence
that the dark matter halo of our Galaxy has a prolate shape with an
average density axis ratio within the orbit of Sgr close to 5/3
(q=1.25).

*"How old do streams have to be before they show noticeable
dissimilarities due to variation in the Galactic dark halo shape? The
kinematics of particles lost between 2 and 4 Gyr ago (Fig. 1, gray dots)
already exhibit important and measurable differences. These are further
highlighted in Figure 3, which plots the trend in the heliocentric
radial velocity as a function of longitude for three different cases for
particles lost in the last 4 Gyr."*

### Johnston et al. 2005

M giants selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) have been
used to trace streams of tidal debris apparently associated with the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) that entirely encircle the
Galaxy. While the Sgr M giants are generally aligned with a single great
circle on the sky, **we measure a difference of 10.4d+/-2.6d between the
mean orbital poles of the great circles that best fit debris leading and
trailing Sgr, which can be attributed to the precession of Sgr\'s orbit
over the range of phases explored by the data set.** Simulations of the
destruction of Sgr in potentials containing bulge, disk, and halo
components best reproduce this level of precession along the same range
of orbital phases if the potential contours of the halo are only
slightly flattened, with the ratio of the axis length perpendicular to
and in the disk in the range q=0.90-0.95 (corresponding to isodensity
contours with qρ\~0.83-0.92). Oblate halos are strongly preferred over
prolate (qρ>1) halos, and **flattenings in the potential of q\<=0.85
(qρ\<=0.75) and q>=1.05 (qρ>=1.1) are ruled out at the 3 σ level. More
extreme values of q\<=0.80 (qρ\<=0.6) and q>=1.25 (qρ>=1.6) are ruled
out at the 7 and 5 σ levels, respectively.** These constraints will
improve as debris with larger separation in orbital phases is found.

*"Visual inspection of this figure confirms the Helmi (2004a) conjecture
that qualitative differences in the apparent thickening or precession of
the most recent debris (i.e., yellow, magenta, and cyan points) are
fairly small over the range of potential flattenings shown, especially
for younger debris. However, it is premature to conclude that these
effects do not lead to measurable variations in the disposition of the
Sgr debris. We now demonstrate that orbital precession of even the most
recent Sgr debris can be measured and used to discriminate between halo
flattening models."*

***"It is conceivable that internal rotation of Sgr perpendicular to the
orbital motion could lead to a systematic offset between the angular
momentum distributions of the leading (trailing) debris, mimicking
orbital precession, but we do not consider this since no systematic
rotation in Sgr's core has been observed."***

*" (1) in general, the separation of poles derived for the leading and
trailing simulated data should increase with increasing deviations from
q = 1, (2) pole separation should be more dramatic for the oblate cases
than the prolate cases, (3) the sense of precession in prolate
potentials is opposite of that in oblate potentials, and (4) some
(oblate-like) precession should be present even in the q = 1 case
because of the presence of a disk component in our Galactic potential."*

NOTES: the model looks pretty good. They find a clear correlation
between pole separation (in degrees) and q (flattening). **Prolate halos
should produce a negative pole separation, contrary to what is
observed.**

### Law et al. 2005:

M giants recovered from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey have recently been
used to map the position and velocity distributions of tidal debris from
the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy around the entire Galaxy.
We compare this data set to both test-particle orbits and N-body
simulations of satellite destruction run within a variety of rigid Milky
Way potentials, and we find that the mass of the Milky Way within 50 kpc
of its center should be (3.8-5.6)×1011Msolar in order for any Sgr orbit
to simultaneously fit the velocity gradient in the Sgr trailing debris
and the apocenter of the Sgr leading debris. **Orbital pole precession
of young debris and leading debris velocities in regions corresponding
to older debris provide contradictory evidence in favor of
oblate/prolate Galactic halo potentials, respectively, leading us to
conclude that the orbit of Sgr has evolved over the past few gigayears.
In light of this discrepancy, we consider constraints from only the
younger portions of the debris within three models of the flattening of
the Galactic potential \[q=0.90 (O), 1.0 (S), and 1.25 (P), i.e.,
oblate, spherical, and prolate\] in our further N-body simulations**. On
the basis of the velocity dispersion and width along the trailing tidal
stream, **we estimate the current bound mass of Sgr to be
MSgr=(2-5)×10\^8 Msolar** independent of the form of the Galactic
potential; this corresponds to a range of mass-to-light ratios
(M/L)Sgr=14-36(M/L)solar for the Sgr core. Models with masses in this
range best fit the apocenter of leading Sgr tidal debris when they orbit
with a radial period of roughly 0.85 Gyr and have perigalactica and
apogalactica of about 15 and 60 kpc, respectively. These distances scale
with the assumed distance to the Sgr dwarf and the assumed depth of the
Galactic potential. The density distribution of debris along the orbit
in these models is consistent with the M giant observations, and debris
at all orbital phases in which M giants are obviously present is younger
(i.e., was lost more recently from the satellite) than the typical age
of a Sgr M giant star.

"The exciting implication of the conclusion of the previous
section---that no single orbit and/or potential can fit all the
data---is that some evolution of Sgr's orbit has occurred over the time
since debris in the leading portion of the streamer, farthest in from
Sgr, was released."

"***As the potential moves from prolate to oblate, the orbit passes
progressively nearer to the Sun, and line-of-sight velocities more
closely reflect the full motion along the orbit. This explains why the
simulated line-of-sight velocities in this region become more extreme
with the oblateness of the potential.** Figure 13 also suggests that
observed debris velocities in the leading region might be accounted for
even in an oblate or spherical potential if the pericenter of Sgr's
orbit has decreased by a factor of order unity within the last 2--3 Gyr
(from visual inspection of the figure), since such a decrease in
pericenter of the Sgr dwarf over time could shift older Sgr debris out
to greater distances from the Sun, corresponding to the greater
pericenter of the dwarf on the passage during which the debris became
unbound.*

*\[..\] Although **dynamical friction seems like the most favorable
explanation** for the orbit evolution, **it does require Sgr to be an
order of magnitude more massive just 2 Gyr ago**, and debris lost at
that time in our mass-follows-light models would have a correspondingly
larger dispersion in velocity (by a factor on the order of sqrt(10) = 3)
and distance. Since the observed velocity dispersion in the debris in
the discrepant, leading portion of the stream is actually quite similar
to that seen in our simulations (17 km/s; see Fig. 10), **this suggests
that, in addition to dropping our assumption of a single orbit for Sgr,
we also have to move beyond modeling Sgr as a single-component system in
order to fit the data.** Hence, while the mean trend in the leading
streamer will tell us how much total mass needs to have been lost from
Sgr, the low dispersion offers the additional opportunity of
constraining how much more tightly the light matter is bound compared to
the dark matter. A study of these combined effects is in progress.*"

NOTES: the contradicting constraints (velocity and pole separation) do
not apply to the younger portion of the stream (i.e., recently stripped
stars).

NOTES: old leading behaves as a prolate halo (i.e., passes far from the
Sun), whereas young material shows signs of oblateness (i.e., positive
orbital pole separation). However, V21 model has the leading arm behave
properly by making the halo transition from oblate in the inner parts to
prolate in the outer parts. But the V21 model has **very low mass** so
the Dynamical Friction effect is not acting properly.

### Fellhauer et al. 2006

The latest Sloan Digital Sky Survey data reveal a prominent bifurcation
in the distribution of debris of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr)
beginning at a right ascension of α\~190deg. Two branches of the stream
(A and B) persist at roughly the same heliocentric distance over at
least 50° of arc. There is also evidence for a more distant structure
(C) well behind the A branch. This paper provides the first explanation
for the bifurcation. **It is caused by the projection of the young
leading (A) and old trailing (B) tidal arms of the Sgr, while the old
leading arm (C) lies well behind A.** This explanation is only possible
**if the halo is close to spherical**, as the angular difference between
the branches is a measure of the precession of the orbital plane.

*"Any asphericity (whether intrinsic to the halo or produced by the
bulge and disk) causes the orbital plane to precess and therefore the
planes of the four arms to be slightly different. The positional
difference between branches A and B is a direct measure of the
precession over two orbital revolutions and hence the asphericity of the
potential. The facts that (1) branches A and B are so close in
projection and (2) branch C lies behind branch A **suggest that the
precession is small, and that the potential is close to spherical.
\[..\] the bifurcation only exists if the axis ratio of the potential Q
at the radii sampled by the Sgr's orbit lies in the range 0.92\<Q \<
0.97.**"*

NOTES: in their model, the faint branch is produced by stellar material
stripped \>7.4 Gyr ago! How massive needs to be Sgr to get this
brightness in the faint branch? Apparently, they claim it cannot be more
massive than 10\^8 (too low compared to current estimates even for the
remaining mass!!)

NOTES: the secondary SGB (Belokurov+06) is explained by the old leading
arm (in V21, the L1p1w). **However, it'd need to be at \>15kpc to the
young leading. Their model predicts a crossing of the old leading and
the young leading at RA\~165. At RA>165, the old leading is closer than
the young leading, contradicting Belokurov+06.**

NOTE: Interestingly enough, it does seem like the angular distance
between the old leading and the dwarf is consistent with more modern
models.

**NOTES: they predict a second bifurcation at Dist>20kpc caused by the
young trailing (faint) and old leading (bright). ?? They base this on a
projection effect (because Belokurov+06 is 2D) but we now know that the
bifurcation (RR Lyrae, e.g. Ramos et al. 2020) is formed by the same two
things at all distances. Is not because at Dist>20kpc another source for
the bifurcation appears!**

### Law et al. 2009:

Observations of the lengthy tidal streams produced by the destruction of
the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph) are capable of providing
strong constraints on the shape of the Galactic gravitational potential.
However, previous work, based on modeling different stream properties in
axisymmetric Galactic models, has yielded conflicting results: while the
angular precession of the Sgr leading arm is most consistent with a
spherical or slightly oblate halo, the radial velocities of stars in
this arm are reproduced only by prolate halo models. We demonstrate that
this apparent paradox can be resolved by instead adopting a triaxial
potential. Our new Galactic halo model, which simultaneously fits all
well-established phase space constraints from the Sgr stream, provides
the **first conclusive evidence for, and tentative measurement of,
triaxiality in an individual dark matter halo**. The Milky Way halo
within \~60 kpc is best characterized by a minor/major axis ratio of the
isovelocity contours c/a ≈ 0.67, intermediate/major axis ratio b/a ≈
0.83, and triaxiality parameter T \~ 0.56. In this model, the minor axis
of the dark halo is coincident with the Galactic X-axis connecting the
Sun and the Galactic center to within \~15°, while the major axis also
lies in the Galactic plane, approximately along the Galactic Y-axis.

### Law & Majewski 2010:

We present a new N-body model for the tidal disruption of the
Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf that is capable of simultaneously satisfying the
majority of angular position, distance, and radial velocity constraints
imposed by current wide-field surveys of its dynamically young (lsim3
Gyr) tidal debris streams. **In particular, this model resolves the
conflicting angular position and radial velocity constraints on the Sgr
leading tidal stream that have been highlighted in recent years.** While
the model does not reproduce the apparent bifurcation observed in the
leading debris stream, **recent observational data suggest that this
bifurcation may represent a constraint on the internal properties of the
Sgr dwarf rather than the details of its orbit**. The key element in the
success of this model is the introduction of a non-axisymmetric
component to the Galactic gravitational potential that can be described
in terms of a triaxial dark matter halo whose minor/major axis ratio
(c/a)Φ = 0.72 and intermediate/major axis ratio (b/a)Φ = 0.99 at radii
20 kpc \< r \< 60 kpc. The minor/intermediate/major axes of this halo
lie along the directions (l, b) = (7°, 0°), (0°, 90°), and (97°, 0°)
respectively, corresponding to a nearly oblate ellipsoid whose minor
axis is contained within the Galactic disk plane. **This particular
disk/halo orientation is difficult to reconcile within the general
context of galactic dynamics** (and cold dark matter models in
particular), suggesting either that the orientation may have evolved
significantly with time or that **inclusion of other non-axisymmetric
components (such as the gravitational influence of the Magellanic
Clouds) in the model may obviate the need for triaxiality in the dark
matter halo.** The apparent proper motion of Sgr in this model is
estimated to be (μ l cos b, μ b ) = (-2.16, 1.73) mas yr-1,
corresponding to a Galactocentric space velocity (U, V, W) = (230, -35,
195) km s-1 . Based on the velocity dispersion in the stellar tidal
streams, we estimate that **Sgr has a current bound mass M Sgr = 2.5+1.3
-1.0 × 10\^8 M sun**. **We demonstrate that with simple assumptions
about the star formation history of Sgr, tidal stripping models
naturally give rise to gradients in the metallicity distribution
function (MDF) along the stellar debris streams similar to those
observed in recent studies.** These models predict a strong evolution in
the MDF of the model Sgr dwarf with time, indicating that the chemical
abundances of stars in Sgr at the present day may be significantly
different than the abundances of those already contributed to the
Galactic stellar halo. We conclude by using the new N-body model to
re-evaluate previous claims of the association of miscellaneous halo
substructure with the Sgr dwarf.

*"The recent observational data presented by Yanny et al. (2009)
indicate that the A and B streams have indistinguishable trends in
distance, radial velocity, metallicity, and mix of stellar types. This
suggests that the A and B branches represent debris stripped from Sgr at
similar times, and that the bifurcation may likely be within a single
phase of tidal debris, originating in substructure within the initial
Sgr dwarf. \[..\] Certainly, if the LSB (faint branch) stream were
significantly older than the HSB (bright branch) we should not expect
the LSB stream to contain as many M-giants as the HSB stream since
M-giants are a young tracer population."*

*"Such tidal debris (gray points in Figure 9) is not observed in the
Field of Streams (although*

*c.f. Niederste-Ostholt et al. 2009 and discussion in D. R. Law et al.
2010, in preparation), suggesting that the Sgr tidal streams are
insufficiently long to produce T1 trailing tidal debris in this region
of sky (or at least, that the stellar density in the stream is declining
sufficiently rapidly that it has not been detected in the SDSS). This
places a limit on the length of the Sgr tidal stream similar to that
derived from other observational constraints that the Sgr tails
represent 3 Gyr worth of tidal debris. If the Sgr tails are so young, we
should not expect any*

*debris corresponding to earlier wraps (i.e., T2/L2) to exist and it is
correspondingly impossible to interpret the bifurcation as the
juxtaposition of Sgr tidal debris torn from Sgr at significantly
different times. We therefore favor the explanation proffered by Yanny
et al. (2009) that both the LSB and HSB streams may represent debris
stripped from Sgr at similar times. \[..\] This presents an alternative
scenario wherein the bifurcation may arise due to substructure within
the initial Sgr dwarf, such as a smaller dwarf satellite that may have
been bound to Sgr when it fell into the gravitational potential of the
Milky Way, or simply to anisotropy of the stellar orbits within the
original dwarf."*

**NOTES: i) they say SDSS does not see the trailing in the north but
that is not true. Belokurov+06 saw the conjunction of the trailing and
the leading near the apocentre of the latter. Plus, several other papers
have claimed to see the trailing in the north as well (Majewski+2004,
Chou+2007). ii) How this adding of the trailing in the north changes
their interpretation of the length of the stream... I'm not sure. But
based on V21, I'd say that it still stands that the stars have not been
stripped for more than 3Gyr. iii) It's not clear to me that the fact
that both bright and faint branches in the leading represent debris
stripped at similar times implies that they are ejected simultaneously
but with different orbits due to the causes they mention. However, it is
true that, if the faint branch is caused by the L1p1w as proposed in
Peñarrubia+10, there should be some metallicity difference between
branches. iv) IF indeed bright and faint are ejected simultaneously,
this MUST increase the mass estimates of the dwarf. But the velocity
dispersion of the stream and the properties of its remnant would then be
at odds with the higher mass... right?**

*"Younger stellar populations might be realistically assumed to be more
tightly bound than older populations, which have had more time to
diffuse outward in the dwarf. Motivated by the presence of such
population gradients within other Galactic dSphs (e.g., Tolstoy et al.
2004) for which the more metal-rich populations are more centrally
concentrated and have lower velocity dispersion, we tag particles in our
best-fit model of the Sgr dwarf to correspond to different stellar
populations according to their total energy in the pre-interaction
dSph."*

NOTE: this has several problems: i) you have young stars even at the
beginning of the simulation (actually, doesn't seem to affect final
result because no star gets stripped before its age). ii) the end result
should show a correlation between distance to the centre of Sgr and
metallicity/age (it does), which is not observed (Giuffrida+10).

From Peñarrubia+10: *"However, LM10 find that in order to reproduce the
location and velocities of the stream the intermediate axis of the dark
matter halo should be aligned with the spin vector of the MW disc. This
is hard to understand as circular orbits about the intermediate axis are
unstable **(e.g. Adams et al. 2007)**"*

### Law & Majewski 2010:

Numerical models of the tidal disruption of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf
galaxy have recently been developed that for the first time
simultaneously satisfy most observational constraints on the angular
position, distance, and radial velocity trends of both leading and
trailing tidal streams emanating from the dwarf. We use these dynamical
models in combination with extant three-dimensional position and
velocity data for Galactic globular clusters and dSph galaxies to
identify those Milky Way satellites that are likely to have originally
formed in the gravitational potential well of the Sgr dwarf, and have
been stripped from Sgr during its extended interaction with the Milky
Way. We conclude that the globular clusters **Arp 2, M 54, NGC 5634,
Terzan 8, and Whiting 1** are almost certainly associated with the Sgr
dwarf, and that Berkeley 29, **NGC 5053, Pal 12, and Terzan 7** are
likely to be as well (albeit at lower confidence). The initial Sgr
system therefore may have contained five to nine globular clusters,
corresponding to a specific frequency SN = 5-9 for an initial Sgr
luminosity MV = -15.0. **Our result is consistent with the 8 ± 2 genuine
Sgr globular clusters expected on the basis of statistical modeling** of
the Galactic globular cluster distribution and the corresponding
false-association rate due to chance alignments with the Sgr streams.
The globular clusters identified as most likely to be associated with
Sgr are consistent with previous reconstructions of the Sgr
age-metallicity relation, and show no evidence for a second-parameter
effect shaping their horizontal branch morphologies. We find no
statistically significant evidence to suggest that any of the recently
discovered population of ultrafaint dwarf galaxies are associated with
the Sgr tidal streams, but are unable to rule out this possibility
conclusively for all systems.

### Peñarrubia et al. 2010:

We use N-body simulations to explore the possibility that the
Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy **was originally a late-type, rotating
disc galaxy,** rather than a non-rotating, pressure-supported dwarf
spheroidal galaxy, as previously thought. **We find that bifurcations in
the leading tail of the Sgr stream, similar to those detected by the
SDSS survey, naturally arise in models where the Sgr disc is misaligned
with respect to the orbital plane**. Moreover, we show that the internal
rotation of the progenitor may strongly alter the location of the
leading tail projected on the sky, and thus affect the constraints on
the shape of the Milky Way dark matter halo that may be derived from
modelling the Sgr stream. Our models provide a clear, easily tested
prediction; **although tidal mass stripping removes a large fraction of
the original angular momentum in the progenitor dwarf galaxy, the
remnant core should still rotate with a velocity amplitude \~20kms-1**
that could be readily detected in future, wide-field kinematic surveys
of the Sgr dwarf.

*"We use test particles to integrate its orbit back in time for a few
orbital periods in order to provide initial conditions for our N-body
realizations of the Sgr dwarf. We find that its orbital peri- and
apocentres in the above potential are 15 and 67 kpc, respectively, which
implies an*

*orbital period of 1.04 Gyr. Currently, Sgr has just (≈34 Myr ago) gone
through its last pericentric passage, and will cross the MW disc in
approximately 28 Myr."*

NOTES: no orbital shrinkage through time considered.

*"The total initial mass of our Sgr model therefore is M = md + mh =
3.5e8 + 2.4e9 = 2.8e9 Msun. \[..\] Also, since we only simulate the most
recent history of the Sgr dwarf, our initial conditions must account for
the fact that the outer halo envelope may have already been lost to
tides at the time when the stellar stream begins to form (see Penarrubia
et al. 2008). To do this, we impose a truncation in the dark matter
density profile at r = rcut = 6Rd, which roughly corresponds to the
tidal radius of a satellite galaxy with mass ∼3 × 10\^9 M at a
pericentre rperi = 15 kpc."*

*"During the stripping process, a fraction of the internal angular
momentum of Sgr transfers to the stream. As a result, the stream tail(s)
do not trace the progenitor's orbit. \[..\] we can appreciate that in
all models both arms show a very similar gradient throughout the sky, in
concordance with observational data. Hence, internal rotation in the Sgr
dwarf mainly affects the apparent precision of the stream plane on the
sky."*

*"By colour coding the particles according to the time at which they are
stripped, we can appreciate that the bifurcation arises from material
lost at consecutive pericentric passages. In particular, the southern,
more prominent tail of the leading arm (stream A) corresponds to stars
that were lost at the third most recent pericentric interaction, i.e. 2
Gyr ago (coloured in red), whilst the fainter northern tail (stream B)
is more recent and is composed of stars that became unbound at the
penultimate pericentre, i.e. 1 Gyr ago (in blue). This result clearly
implies that the minimum age of the Sgr stream is two orbital periods,
which justifies the choice of integration time for our N-body models."*

NOTES: the faint branch is due to the L2p1w material in terms of V21
model. This has a pro and a con. Pro: it naturally explains why it ends
earlier than the bright branch. Con: its metallicity should be higher.

*"Together with observed metallicity patterns that are atypical for
dSphs, this suggests that the Sgr dwarf may have originally been a
galaxy akin to late-type spirals with a peak rotation of 45 km s−1."*

NOTES: bold...

### Myers et al. 2010:

In hierarchical models of large-scale structure formation, most galaxies
grow in clusters, where merging is an essential, if not dominant
process. Understanding the merger process is greatly aided by examples
in the vicinity of the Milky Way due to the availability of high quality
positional and kinematic data. The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy at a
distance of 25 kpc is a prime example. Detailed observations of stars in
this dwarf galaxy and its associated tidal streams also provide a unique
probe of the gravitational field of the Milky Way. To fully utilize this
probe requires not only excellent observations but also accurate models
of the merging event. We investigate the recent history of the
Sagittarius Dwarf with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics/N-body
GADGET-2 code, treating both the Milky Way and the dwarf galaxy as a
particle system. In addition to considerations of particle number,
gravitational softening, stability criteria such as Toomre Q parameter,
and angular momentum transport, we add the distinction between static
and dynamic potential differences as another aspect that deserves
consideration. We find that the commonly employed approximation of a
static Milky Way potential induces changes in the orbit corresponding to
position changes on the sky of order 0.5°-1°. **The weak dependence of
the results on the live versus static Milky Way model justify the use of
static potentials in situations which do not require very high
positional accuracy.**

"To treat the static gravitational potential of the MW, we do not employ
analytical models for the potential, but instead **fix the MW particles'
position** while allowing the SDG particles to move in response to the
total gravitational potential of the system. \[..\] In the case of the
dynamic potential of the MW, the MW particles are treated in the usual
N-body fashion."

NOTES: in the static case, everything is almost the same, but no
dynamical friction or resonant effects at play.

*"The assumed initial position of the SDG relative to the center of the
MW was determined by performing a simple two-body evolution to 2 Gyr in
the past. \[..\] We calculate the orbital path of the SDG galaxy
starting from its initial point ∼1.2 Gyr in the past."*

NOTES: that is an extremely short time!! Of course they do not observe
any difference between the static and live simulations...

### Lokas et al. 2010

The tidal stirring model envisions the formation of dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) galaxies in the Local Group and similar environments via the
tidal interaction of disky dwarf systems with a larger host galaxy like
the Milky Way. These progenitor disks are embedded in extended dark
halos and during the evolution both components suffer strong mass loss.
In addition, the disks undergo the morphological transformation into
spheroids and the transition from ordered to random motion of their
stars. Using collisionless N-body simulations, we construct a model for
the nearby and highly elongated Sagittarius (Sgr) dSph galaxy within the
framework of the tidal stirring scenario. Constrained by the present
orbit of the dwarf, which is fairly well known, the model suggests that
in order to produce the majority of tidal debris observed as the Sgr
stream, but not yet transform the core of the dwarf into a spherical
shape, **Sgr must have just passed the second pericenter of its current
orbit around the Milky Way.** In the model, the stellar component of Sgr
is still very elongated after the second pericenter and morphologically
intermediate between the strong bar formed at the first pericenter and
the almost spherical shape existing after the third pericenter. **This
is thus the first model of the evolution of the Sgr dwarf that accounts
for its observed very elliptical shape.** At the present time, there is
very little intrinsic rotation left and **the velocity gradient detected
along the major axis is almost entirely of tidal origin.** We model the
recently measured velocity dispersion profile for Sgr assuming that mass
traces light and estimate its **current total mass within 5 kpc to be
5.2 × 10\^8 M sun**. To have this mass at present, the model requires
that the **initial virial mass of Sgr must have been as high as 1.6 ×
10\^10 M sun**, comparable to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which
may serve as a suitable analog for the pre-interaction, Sgr progenitor.

"In the simulation described below that reproduced best the observed
properties of Sgr, the dwarf progenitor initially had a dark halo with a
virial mass M = 1.6 × 10\^10 M and a concentration of c = 15. **The mass
and radial scale length of the disk were 3.2 × 10\^8 M and Rd = 2.3 kpc,
respectively. \[..\] The orbit was inclined by 76◦ to the Galactic plane
and the dwarf galaxy disk was inclined by 10◦ with respect to the
orbital plane."**

**NOTE: they actually simulated a disc! But there is no study of the
bifurcation. Could be that it does not appear because of the low
relative angle between the disc and the orbit. But they manage to get a
final shape that explains the elongation of the remnant and the fact
that it has no rotation left!**

*"\[Peñarrubia+10\] showed that if their initial disk was inclined by
about 20◦ with respect to the orbital plane then the bifurcation would
be reproduced. While an intriguing hypothesis for the origin of the
enigmatic bifurcation, our work suggests that the initial inclination of
the disk was probably about a factor of 2 lower since otherwise the
stellar component forms a pronounced S-shape that is not observed in the
real data."*

*"Note however that some mass loss in stars and the formation of stellar
streams could take place even before the phases of evolution we study in
this paper. Thus, more pericenter passages than two may have occurred in
total, but the earlier ones at large radii will have minimal effect on
the internal structure of Sgr (Kazantzidis et al. 2010)."*

*"The shape of the dwarf galaxy disk evolves so that after the first
pericenter a bar is formed (b/a = c/a). This bar soon transforms into a
triaxial, but still prolate shape. At the second pericenter the bar
becomes stronger again and at the moment shown in Figure 3, which
corresponds to the present state of Sgr, the dwarf is still quite
elongated with b/a = 0.83 and c/a = 0.72 inside the inner 1 kpc. Note
that these values depend on radius and would be b/a = 0.64 and c/a =
0.57 when measured within the disk initial scale length r\<Rd = 2.3 kpc.
Right after the second pericenter the stellar component becomes almost
spherical with b/a and c/a both very close to unity. The shape becomes a
little elongated again at the third pericenter because the tidal forces
are at their maximum. \[..\] The changes of the shape of the stellar
component are accompanied by a strong mass loss and decreasing rotation
velocity Vrot of the stars **(from \~25 km/s to \~2km/s in the inner
1kpc).**"*

### Purcell et al. 2011:

Like many galaxies of its size, the Milky Way is a disk with prominent
spiral arms rooted in a central bar, although our knowledge of its
structure and origin is incomplete. Traditional attempts to understand
our Galaxy\'s morphology assume that it has been unperturbed by major
external forces. Here we report simulations of the response of the Milky
Way to the infall of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), which results
in the formation of spiral arms, influences the central bar and produces
a flared outer disk. **Two ring-like wrappings emerge towards the
Galactic anti-Centre in our model that are reminiscent of the
low-latitude arcs observed in the same area of the Milky Way.** Previous
models have focused on Sgr itself to reproduce the dwarf\'s orbital
history and place associated constraints on the shape of the Milky Way
gravitational potential, treating the Sgr impact event as a trivial
influence on the Galactic disk. **Our results show that the Milky Way\'s
morphology is not purely secular in origin and that low-mass minor
mergers predicted to be common throughout the Universe probably have a
similarly important role in shaping galactic structure.**

*"\[..\] although best estimates (Conroy+09, Behroozi+10) place it in a
much more massive halo of roughly 10\^11 M⊙."*

*"The Light Sgr (Heavy Sgr) progenitor with effective virial mass Mvir =
10\^10.5 M⊙ (10\^11 M⊙) was initialized with an NFW dark halo of scale
length 4.9 kpc (6.5 kpc) self-consistently with a separate stellar
component motivated by an analysis of the observed Sgr debris and core:
a King profile with core radius 1.5 kpc, tidal radius 4.0 kpc, and
central velocity dispersion equal to 23 km s-1. Following previous work
on the Sgr interaction22, our satellites started 80 kpc from the
Galactic Center in the plane of the Milky Way, traveling vertically at
80 km s-1 toward the North Galactic Pole. **We account for the mass loss
that would have occurred between virial-radius infall and this "initial"
location by truncating the Sgr progenitor NFW mass profile at the
instantaneous Jacobi tidal radius, rt = 23.2 kpc (30.6 kpc),** leaving a
total bound mass that is factor of \~3 smaller than their effective
virial mass from abundance matching."*

NOTES: First model to have the right young trailing arm (i.e., it goes
far beyond 80kpc). But their leading arm only does 1 extra wrap (instead
of two like V21 model). Also, in the case of the light Sgr, their
trailing arm seems a bit short compared to the detections of
Correnti+2010.

NOTES: the integration is very similar to V21 but it does not eject
stars (or very very few) on its first pericentre because of the DM
shielding. This might be due to the difference in the initial conditions
and the "fake" DM truncation imposed.

### Niederste-Ostholt et al. 2012:

The Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy is the archetype of a tidally
disrupting system. Both leading and trailing tails can be observed
across at least 180° of the sky and measurements of their luminosity
density profiles have recently become available. Using numerical
simulations, we explore the factors that control the appearance of such
profiles.

We use two possible models for the Sgr progenitor. The first is a
one-component Plummer model, which may represent either a dark matter
free progenitor, or one in which pre-existing dark matter has already
been largely stripped. The second is a two-component model in which the
stars are represented by a Hernquist sphere embedded in a cosmologically
modish Navarro-Frenk-White dark halo. Disruption of the models in the
Milky Way galaxy provides us with two tellings of the tale of the
formation of the Sgr stream. **The initial disintegration of the baryons
proceeds more slowly for the two-component models because of the
protective cocoon of dark matter. Once this has been stripped, though,
matters proceed apace. In both cases, the profiles after ∼6 pericentric
passages provide good matches to the observational data, but the tails
are more extended for the two-component models.**

The leading and trailing tails are symmetric at apocentre or pericentre.
At other orbital phases, asymmetries are present, as tails are
compressed as they approach apocentre and stretched out as they approach
pericentre. **There may exist density enhancements corresponding to such
pile-ups which may be observable in current survey data.** We re-visit
the calculation of Niederste-Ostholt et al. and **slightly revise
upwards the luminosity of the Sgr progenitor to 9.9-14.4 × 10\^7 L⊙
based on insights from the simulations.**

### Gibbons et al. 2014:

Motivated by recent observations of the Sagittarius stream, we devise a
rapid algorithm to generate faithful representations of the centroids of
stellar tidal streams formed in a disruption of a progenitor of an
arbitrary mass in an arbitrary potential. Our method works by releasing
swarms of test particles at the Lagrange points around the satellite and
subsequently evolving them in a combined potential of the host and the
progenitor. We stress that the action of the progenitor\'s gravity is
crucial to making streams that look almost indistinguishable from the
N-body realizations, as indeed ours do. The method is tested on mock
stream data in three different Milky Way potentials with increasing
complexity, and is shown to deliver unbiased inference on the Galactic
mass distribution out to large radii. When applied to the observations
of the Sagittarius stream, our model gives a natural explanation of the
stream\'s apocentric distances and the differential orbital precession.
We, therefore, provide a new independent measurement of the Galactic
mass distribution beyond 50 kpc. The Sagittarius stream model favours a
light Milky Way with the mass 4.1 ± 0.4 × 10\^11 M⊙ at 100 kpc, which
can be extrapolated to 5.6 ± 1.2 × 10\^11 M⊙ at 200 kpc. Such a low mass
for the Milky Way Galaxy is in good agreement with estimates from the
kinematics of halo stars and from the satellite galaxies (once Leo I is
removed from the sample). It entirely removes the \`Too Big To Fail
Problem\'.

***"If the progenitor's gravity is not included, the model stream barely
reaches half of the length of the N-body representation."***

NOTE: they use spherical models controlled by three parameters, a
velocity scale factor, the radial scale length, and the power-law
coefficient that governs the radial profile. It was shown, from all the
other models (previous and posteriors) that, to reproduce properly Sgr,
you need to account for at least triaxiality and the Magellanic clouds.

NOTES: current mass estimates of the MW are roughly double their
estimate. Therefore, it seems like their model is indeed biased.

### Hernitschek+17

"*In more recent work, Belokurov et al. (2014) have demonstrated that
the trailing arm of the Sgr stream can be traced out to its apocenter at
\~100 kpc. They also give a fit of the stream's leading arm to its
apocenter at \~50 kpc.*"

Distances in this work are calculated as explained in Sesar+17
(Machine-learned Identification of RR Lyrae Stars from Sparse,
Multi-band Data: The PS1 Sample): **most of the stars don't have
metallicity so they impose -1.5dex.**

### Dierickx+17: 

The extensive span of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream makes it a promising
tool for studying the gravitational potential of the Milky Way (MW).
Characterizing its stellar kinematics can constrain halo properties and
provide a benchmark for the paradigm of galaxy formation from cold dark
matter. Accurate models of the disruption dynamics of the Sgr progenitor
are necessary to employ this tool. Using a combination of analytic
modeling and N-body simulations, we build a new model of the Sgr orbit
and resulting stellar stream. In contrast to previous models, we
simulate the full infall trajectory of the Sgr progenitor from the time
it first crossed the MW virial radius 8 Gyr ago. An exploration of the
parameter space of initial phase-space conditions yields tight
constraints on the angular momentum of the Sgr progenitor. **Our
best-fit model is the first to accurately reproduce existing data on the
3D positions and radial velocities of the debris detected 100 kpc away
in the MW halo.** In addition to replicating the mapped stream, **the
simulation also predicts the existence of several arms of the Sgr stream
extending to hundreds of kiloparsecs.** The two most distant stars known
in the MW halo coincide with the predicted structure. Additional stars
in the newly predicted arms can be found with future data from the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope. Detecting a statistical sample of stars in
the most distant Sgr arms would provide an opportunity to constrain the
MW potential out to unprecedented Galactocentric radii.

*"If we apply these equations then the current position vector of the
center of Sgr is rSgr,obs = - (16.1, 2.35, 6.12) kpc, in agreement with
the values provided, e.g., by Law & Majewski (2010). The heliocentric
radial velocity of Sgr has been measured as 140 ± 0.33 km s−1 (weighted
mean of the estimates of the average velocities of Sgr,N and M54 in
Table 5 of Bellazzini et al. 2008), and its proper motion in the
equatorial coordinate system is (μα, μδ) = (−2.95 ± 0.18, −1.19 ± 0.16)
mas yr−1 (Massari et al. 2013). Using these heliocentric velocity
components, the Cartesian, right-handed Galactic space velocity (U, V,
W) is calculated following Johnson & Soderblom (1987). Finally, these
heliocentric space velocities are converted to the Galactic Rest Frame
(GSR) by adding contributions from the local standard of rest and solar
peculiar motions (Schönrich et al. 2010; Reid et al. 2014): This yields
a current GSR velocity vector for Sgr of **vSgr,obs = (242.5, 5.6,
228.1) km s−1** and a total magnitude of the velocity of 333 ± 30 km
s−1"*

"**Importantly, inferring the orbit from evolving a test particle
backward in time does not capture tidal stripping effects on the
progenitor halo. This approach is valid in the regime of low mass, low
dynamical friction, and low stripping outlined by Jiang & Binney (2000),
but cannot recover earlier infall phases for a progenitor with mass 109
Me. The initial mass of Sgr used by Law & Majewski (2010) is 6.4 × 108
Me, distinctly in the regime where dynamical friction is unimportant.**"

"A halo's scale radius rs is related to its virial radius Rvir and
concentration parameter c by the relationship rs = Rvir/c. As the halo
accretes mass on its outskirts, the scale radius is maintained constant
while the virial radius and the concentration parameter grow."

NOTE: In this work, the authors basically do a first exploration of
parameters with a method similar to NBodyDirect (Gala) -\> test particle
simulations but at the same time the particles feel each other's
potential. With that, they can do a first fast exploration of the
parameter space. Then, they run N-body models from the optimal point. No
LMC but yes dynamical friction. Also, they start the simulations 8Gyr
ago, putting Sagitarius at a Galactocentric distance of aprox. 150 kpc.

One of the main points they raise (from the first type of simulations)
is only a small set of initial angular momentum at the moment when Sgr
crossed the Virial radius of the MW are allowed. However, even if it is
true, the values they derive do not take into consideration the
interaction with the LMC. Which, as Vera-Ciro&Helmi13 shows, introduced
a significant kick in the angular momentum of Sgr just right before the
present time. Therefore, we cannot calculate the angular momentum at
entry from the current phase-space of Sgr without taking LMC into
account.

Their N-Body doesn't much so nicely the data and also their plots are in
RA-DEC, making it hard to compare to observations. However, the two-step
strategy is something. NOTE: in the N-Body simulation, even though it
starts from the same point, the orbit degradates much faster -\>
dynamical friction is more efficient than they anticipated in their
simple recipe (Chandrasekar equation but with lots of assumptions).
**Either their assumptions are wrong or their mass loss recipe is.**

### Fardal+19

Recent maps of the halo using RR Lyrae from Pan-STARRS1 depict the
spatial structure of the Sagittarius stream, showing the leading and
trailing stream apocentres differ in Galactocentric radius by a factor
of 2, and also resolving substructure in the stream at these apocentres.
Here we present dynamical models that reproduce these features of the
stream **in simple Galactic potentials.** **We find that debris at the
apocentres must be dynamically young, being stripped off in pericentric
passages either one or two orbital periods ago.** The ratio of the
leading and trailing apocentres is sensitive to both dynamical friction
and the outer slope of the Galactic rotation curve. These dependencies
can be understood with simple regularities connecting the apocentric
radii, circular velocities, and orbital period of the progenitor. **The
effect of dynamical friction can be constrained using substructure
within the leading apocentre.** Our models are far from final; the
errors allowed when sampling parameter space are deliberately generous,
not every stream feature is reproduced, and we explore a limited set of
potentials. Still, it is interesting that we consistently find the mass
within 100 kpc to be ∼ 7 × 10\^{11} M\_{⊙}, with a nearly flat rotation
curve between 50 and 100 kpc. This points to a more extended Galactic
halo than assumed in some current models. We show one example model in
various observational dimensions. **A plot of velocity versus distance
separates younger from older debris, and suggests that the young
trailing debris will serve as an especially useful probe of the outer
Galactic potential.**

NOTE: The Ramos+20 median matches better with their Model A than the RR
Lyrae from Sesar et al. 2017b (Table 1).

NOTE: their statement that the velocity vs distance separates debris by
Tstrip is not fulfilled in V21 model, where, incidentally, the leading
apocentre is formed by stars stripper 3 pericentres ago.

### Vasiliev et al. 2021

*"The best-fit halo shape and orientation is indeed rather peculiar:
**the inner part of the halo is moderately oblate, with axis ratio z : R
\' 0.5 − 0.6, while the outer part is strongly prolate and misaligned
with the principal axes of the disc.** It has long been recognised that
the halo needs to be nonspherical in order to produce the observed
morphology of the leading arm: in a spherical halo, it bends much more
strongly, and the stream crosses the Galactic plane around the Solar
radius, not at ∼ 10 − 15 kpc from the Sun as warranted by observations
(see e.g. Belokurov et al. 2006; Yanny et al. 2009). Allowing the halo
to be prolate (extending more along the z axis) in the outer part
"unbends" the leading arm and moves its disc crossing point further out,
while the additional flexibility allowed by misaligned principal axes
improves the fit of the stream track. At the same time, the oblate inner
part aligned with the disc shifts the distant portion of the trailing
arm up (closer to the Galactic plane), improving the fit for both the
distance and velocity at Λ \< −100◦."*

### Bland-Hawthorn2021:

*"For consistency with most earlier work, especially Binney & Sch¨onrich
(2018), we adopt an initial perturber mass of 2 × 1010 M to drive the
impulse (see also G´omez et al. 2013). Earlier work has already shown
that this is the lowmass threshold needed to drive the necessary
response (L19, B19); models using a lower perturber mass can account for
Sgr's tidal tails (e.g. Law et al. 2005) but produce a very weak
vertical disc response. We do not view the apparent inconsistency with
observations as a problem. If the phase spiral phenomenon is long-lived,
a disc crossing prior to the current event may in fact be responsible.
But this raises new questions about the stripping rate experienced by
Sgr as a function of time, issues we address in Sec. 6."*

## Notes

**It seems like its MDF spans from -2.0 to \> -0.5 dex which suggests
enrichment (Cacciari et al. 2002)**

### Chou+07:

"*In a recent reanalysis of the age-metallicity relationship in Sgr,
Bellazzini et al. (2006a) find that the dSph may have enriched to
near-solar metallicity as early as 6 Gyr ago, although a more recent
analysis by Siegel et al. (2007) suggests a somewhat slower evolution to
this enrichment level.*"

"*On the other hand, Bellazzini et al. (2006b) found significant
differences in the relative numbers of blue horizontal-branch to red
clump stars between the Sgr core and a position about 75 forward along
the Sgr leading arm, an imbalance that suggests a significant
metallicity variation along the Sgr stream.*"

The sample of Chou is extremely local. At that point, Enceladus was not
known and, even if they selected stars according to their radial
velocities (matching the models) that does not guarantee that they are
from Sgr. The results of this study must be taken with care. They do
have a sample of most likely members of the leading arm that is somewhat
reasonable but still too few objects.

On the other hand, the analysis by Zhang+17 is more convincing. In their
work, the gradient is almost nonexistent, especially for the Leading
arm.

"*We derive a metallicity gradient \[\...\] of **-(1.6 ± 0.4) × 10-6**
dex deg-1 for the leading arm 1, and of -(1.3 ± 0.3) × 10-3 dex deg-1
for the trailing arm 1.*"

NOTE: there's a difference between metallicity gradient within the arm
and metallicity gradient w.r.t. the core of Sgr.

### Tepper-Garcia+18:

*" We find that the gas stripping was 30--50 per cent complete at its
first disc crossing ∼2.7 Gyr ago, then entirely stripped at its last
disc crossing ∼1 Gyr ago."*

"the high-contrast three-dimensional view given by the RR Lyraes in

Fig.1: RRab stars within \|B∣\< 9º as obtained after fitting of the
period (Sesar et al. 2017c). The Sgr stream is clearly visible up to
\~130 kpc. The color indicates the median angular distance B˜ of a 5 ´ 5
kpc bin (in L˜ and D coordinates) from the Sgr orbital plane = B˜ 0 .
This was chosen due to the high source density in some regions. In this
figure, the angular coordinate L˜ runs from - 20 to 380 with repeated
data points for L\< ˜ 0 and L \> ˜ 360 , to better show the distribution
near L\~ ˜ 0 . The locations of the Sun, Galactic anticenter, Sgr dSph,
and the Virgo overdensity (Vivas et al. 2001; Newberg et al. 2003; Jurić
et al. 2008) are indicated. The dashed line marks the position of the
Galactic plane. The centroid for Sgr dSph was taken from Karachentsev et
al. (2004). The Cetus stream should cross the Sgr stream at L\~270º
,B\~1º (Newberg et al. 2009). Evidence from our data is marginal.

"*The prior for Dsgr depends on L, and is uniform within (Dminprior(L)
), (Dmaxprior(L) ) as indicated in Figure 4 and listed in Tables 2 and
3. Whereas the prior is generally wide, a quite restrictive prior was
chosen for 20\<=L\<30 and 30\<=L\<40, because the fit otherwise behaves
poorly because of the background sources along these l.o.s.*"

**If the prior is chosen poorly, they might be biasing the results
towards what is known.**

They look for the optimal parameters through MCMC given a model of the
Halo. So, model-dependent and non-deterministic.

From Clementini+19 we learn that the metallicity is given using
equations (2) and (4) of Nemec+13 for, respectively, RRab and RRc.

If we now go to Nemec+13, we see that the metallicities for RRab are
computed in a non-linear way and thus the relation with the JK96 scale
(bias by +0.3 wrt Zinn&West84, see Gratton+04) depends on the location
in the Periods vs ${{\phi_{31}}^{s}}_{}$:

![](.//media/image2.png){width="6.270833333333333in" height="7.625in"}

However, the stars selected by nGC3 fall predominantly at the regions
where the relation JK96 to Nemec13 is almost one-to-one. Therefore, for
most of our RRab, we need to subtract 0.3dex (-0.3) to put them in the
Z&W84 scale. However, if we take the relation in Eq. (5) of
Kunder&Chaboyer 2008, we can fit directly the metallicity in the Z&W84
scale -\> \[Fe/H\]~ZW~\~-1.55dex.

![](.//media/image16.png){width="5.208333333333333in"

![](.//media/image18.png){width="5.208333333333333in"
height="4.166666666666667in"}

Regarding the RRc stars, the relation is linear and we can already see
the offset wrt to Z&W84 in the following figure, also from
Nemec+13:![](.//media/image3.png){width="6.270833333333333in"
height="7.527777777777778in"}

When we take the mean metallicity of DPAC for RRc stars at distance \>
17kpc (approx.) we get a \[Fe/H\]~C9~\~-1.65. By solving for
\[Fe/H\]~ZW~ in (see Carretta+09):

\[Fe/H\]UVES = −0.413(±0.027) + 0.130 (±0.289)\[Fe/H\]ZW −0.356
(±0.108)\[Fe/H\]ZW\^2

We obtain \[Fe/H\]~ZW~\~ -1.69 (close to the metallicities derived by
Viva+05).

With this, we get \[Fe/H\]~ZW~=-1.60dex for RRab (the dominant fraction,
\~85%) and \[Fe/H\]~ZW~=-1.69dex for RRc (\~15%).

However, if we use the relations used by Cseresnjes+01, we get
\[Fe/H\]~ZW~=-1.57dex for RRab and \[Fe/H\]~ZW~=-1.62dex for RRc.

So, even though it seems like the RRc are more metal-poor either way, we
can assume a constant metallicity at \[Fe/H\]~ZW~=-1.60 as a compromise
among all the determinations. Plus, the Muraveva+18 relations are fitted
with a largely dominated sample of RRab stars only.

Belokurov+06 shows the discovery of the bifurcation in the north
galactic hemisphere (leading arm). Not much said about the nature of it
apart from showing the morphology (projected) and that there is almost
no separation in distance.

Koposov+12 reports that the bifurcation can also be seen in the south
(trailing). Uses Gaussian fit to Beta histograms to follow the angular
separation and widths from Lambda \~ -120deg to -80deg. **Uses SDSS
photometry of the stars -5\<Beta\<5 vs 8\<Beta\<12 to argue that the
faint branch has a much thinner sub-giant and red-branch regions. Also,
that it does not have multiple turn off or a prominent red clump.**
*This is not true!!*

"To check that the latter is not an artifact caused by low number
statistics in the faint stream, we modeled the ratio of red clump to
MSTO stars using a decomposition of the density profile into two
Gaussians (as used for Figure 2). With 95% confidence, this ratio in the
fainter stream is smaller than that in the brighter. This suggests the
existence of a simpler and more metal-poor population in the fainter
stream, and more complex and more metal-rich population in the brighter
stream."

This claim is sustained by the bright branch having a thicker MSTO at
i-mags of \~21mag. Their figure is totally saturated so it is impossible
to check if that is just an effect of downsampling. But the ratio should
be robust to observational effects...

Then, they say that the plot (below) proves their point, that is, that
the bright branch has significantly more metal-rich stars than the
faint.

They advocate for two different streams with different properties based
on incomplete CMD data. *Our results, although confirming the difference
in mean metallicity, do show very similar CMDs between 2 branches.*

In this sense, Koposov discusses that the 2 wraps model (Fellhauer et
al. 2006) does not produce a bifurcation in the south (plus, their
trailing apocentre is far too close to the Sun thus their argument needs
revision), whereas the model by Peñarrubia et al. 2010 doesn't have
population differences between the two branches (plus, it is not known
whether it produces a bifurcation in the trailing arm).

The Fellhauer model does not match the current data of the stream in any
way, apart from the appreciations done in Koposov+12.

## Miscellaneous

### Forbes & Bridges 2010:

​​A large, perhaps dominant fraction, of the Milky Way\'s halo is thought
to be built up by the accretion of smaller galaxies and their globular
cluster (GC) systems. Here, we examine the Milky Way\'s GC system to
estimate the fraction of accreted versus in situ formed GCs. We first
assemble a high-quality data base of ages and metallicities for 93 Milky
Way GCs from literature deep colour-magnitude data. The age-metallicity
relation for Milky Way\'s GCs reveals two distinct tracks - one with
near constant old age of \~12.8 Gyr and the other branches to younger
ages. We find that the latter young track is dominated by GCs associated
with the Sagittarius and Canis Major dwarf galaxies. Despite being
overly simplistic, its age-metallicity relation can be well represented
by a simple closed box model with continuous star formation. The
inferred chemical enrichment history is similar to that of the Large
Magellanic Cloud, but is more enriched, at a given age, compared to the
Small Magellanic Cloud.

After excluding Sagittarius and Canis Major GCs, several young track GCs
remain. Their horizontal branch morphologies are often red and hence
classified as young halo objects; however, they do not tend to reveal
extended horizontal branches (a possible signature of an accreted
remnant nucleus). Retrograde orbit GCs (a key signature of accretion)
are commonly found in the young track. We also examine GCs that lie
close to the Fornax-Leo-Sculptor great circle defined by several
satellite galaxies. We find that several GCs are consistent with the
young track and we speculate that they may have been accreted along with
their host dwarf galaxy, whose nucleus may survive as a GC. Finally, we
suggest that 27-47 GCs (about 1/4 of the entire system), from six to
eight dwarf galaxies, were accreted to build the Milky Way GC system we
see today.

### Lux et al. 2010:

We calculate orbits for the Milky Way dwarf galaxies with proper
motions, and compare these to subhalo orbits in a high-resolution
cosmological simulation. We use the simulation data to assess how well
orbits may be recovered in the face of measurement errors, a
time-varying triaxial gravitational potential and satellite-satellite
interactions. For present measurement uncertainties, we recover the
apocentre ra and pericentre rp to \~40 per cent. With improved data from
the Gaia satellite we should be able to recover ra and rp to \~14 per
cent, respectively. However, recovering the 3D positions and orbital
phase of satellites over several orbits is more challenging. This owes
primarily to the non-sphericity of the potential and satellite
interactions during group infall. Dynamical friction, satellite
mass-loss and the mass evolution of the main halo play a more minor role
in the uncertainties.

We apply our technique to nine Milky Way dwarfs with observed proper
motions. We show that their mean apocentre is lower than the mean of the
most massive subhaloes in our cosmological simulation, but consistent
with the most massive subhaloes that form before z = 10. This lends
further support to the idea that the Milky Way\'s dwarfs formed before
reionization.

### Kazantzidis et al. 2011:

The tidal stirring model posits the formation of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies (dSphs) via the tidal interactions between late-type,
rotationally supported dwarfs and Milky-Way-sized host galaxies. Using a
comprehensive set of collisionless N-body simulations, we investigate
the efficiency of the tidal stirring mechanism for the origin of dSphs.
In particular, we examine the degree to which the tidal field of the
primary galaxy affects the sizes, masses, shapes, and kinematics of the
disky dwarfs for a range of dwarf orbital and structural parameters. Our
study is the first to employ self-consistent, equilibrium models for the
progenitor dwarf galaxies constructed from a composite distribution
function and consisting of exponential stellar disks embedded in
massive, cosmologically motivated dark matter halos. Exploring a wide
variety of dwarf orbital configurations and initial structures, we
demonstrate that in the majority of cases the disky dwarfs experience
significant mass loss and their stellar distributions undergo a dramatic
morphological, as well as dynamical, transformation. Specifically, the
stellar components evolve from disks to bars and finally to
pressure-supported, spheroidal systems with kinematic and structural
properties akin to those of the classic dSphs in the Local Group (LG)
and similar environments. The self-consistency of the adopted dwarf
models is crucial for confirming this complex transformation process via
tidally induced dynamical instabilities and impulsive tidal heating of
the stellar distribution. Our results suggest that such tidal
transformations should be common occurrences within the currently
favored cosmological paradigm and highlight the key factor responsible
for an effective metamorphosis to be the strength of the tidal shocks at
the pericenters of the orbit. We also demonstrate that the combination
of short orbital times and small pericentric distances, characteristic
of dwarfs being accreted by their hosts at high redshift, induces the
strongest and most complete transformations. Our models also indicate
that the efficiency of the transformation via tidal stirring is affected
significantly by the structure of the progenitor disky dwarfs. While the
mass-to-light ratios, M/L, of the dwarf galaxies typically decrease
monotonically with time as the extended dark matter halos are
efficiently tidally stripped, we identify a few cases where this trend
is reversed later in the evolution when stellar mass loss becomes more
effective. We also find that the dwarf remnants satisfy the relation
V_max = √{3}σ\_{\*}, where σ\* is the one-dimensional, central stellar
velocity dispersion and V max is the maximum halo circular velocity,
which has intriguing implications for the missing satellites problem.
Assuming that the distant dSphs in the LG, such as Leo I, Tucana, and
Cetus, are the products of tidal stirring, our findings suggest that
these galaxies should have only been partially stirred by the tidal
field of their hosts. We thus predict that these remote dwarfs should
exhibit higher values of V rot/σ\*, where V rot is the stellar
rotational velocity, compared with those of dSphs located closer to the
primary galaxies. Overall, we conclude that the action of tidal forces
from the hosts constitutes a crucial evolutionary mechanism for shaping
the nature of dwarf galaxies in environments such as that of the LG.
Environmental mechanisms of this type should thus be included as
ingredients in models of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution.

NOTES: basically generalises the results of Lokas et al. 2010 to any
disky dwarf.

## Curiosities

### Kesden, Michael & Kamionkowski, Marc 2006

Satellite galaxies currently undergoing tidal disruption offer a unique
opportunity to constrain an effective violation of the equivalence
principle in the dark sector. While dark matter in the standard scenario
interacts solely through gravity on large scales, a new long-range force
between dark-matter particles may naturally arise in theories in which
the dark matter couples to a light scalar field. An inverse-square-law
force of this kind would manifest itself as a violation of the
equivalence principle in the dynamics of dark matter compared to baryons
in the form of gas or stars. In a previous paper, we showed that an
attractive force would displace stars outwards from the bottom of the
satellite's gravitational potential well, leading to a higher fraction
of stars being disrupted from the tidal bulge further from the Galactic
center. Since stars disrupted from the far (near) side of the satellite
go on to form the trailing (leading) tidal stream, an attractive
dark-matter force will produce a relative enhancement of the trailing
stream compared to the leading stream. This distinctive signature of a
dark-matter force might be detected through detailed observations of the
tidal tails of a disrupting satellite, such as those recently performed
by the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) on the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy. Here we show that this
signature is robust to changes in our models for both the satellite and
Milky Way, suggesting that we might hope to search for a dark-matter
force in the tidal features of other recently discovered satellite
galaxies in addition to the Sgr dwarf.

## Sgr orbital plane

The first tests have shown a discrepancy in the determination of the
pole of Sgr stream. However, this might be correct because, when
colouring the stream by B_sol we see that is not centred at zero:

![](.//media/image19.png){width="3.0781255468066493in"
height="2.478254593175853in"}

We have also checked that the change used is coherent up to the level of
1e-5 degrees with the equations given in Belokurov+14.

It is centred, however, with the trailing tail, as it was intended.
